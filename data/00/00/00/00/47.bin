希望能快去快回

32

00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,710
不要  我不要你走
No. I don't want you to go.

39
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:34,880
肯定可无聊了
It's gonna be so boring.

40
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:36,730
我会困得睁不开
I won't be able to keep my...

00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:37,950
眼睛
eyes...

42
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:44,180
再见  亲爱的  我们很快就回来
Goodbye, sweetheart. All right, we'll see you soon.

43
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:46,270
好
Okay.

44
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:47,990
珍妮特  我们得走了
Janet, we gotta go.

45
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:53,090
真希望我们能够放下行李
I wish we could have put down our bags...

46
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:55,250
哄你上床
tucked you back into your bed...

47
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:57,950
但这事关太多性命
but too many lives were at stake.

48
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,960
天呐
Oh, my God.

49
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,550
已经发射了
They've already launched.

50
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:07,220
我们得拦截它
We have to stop it.

51
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:08,030
走吧
Come on.

52
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,040
要拆除导弹  我们必须进去
To disarm the missile, we had to get inside it

53
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:22,540
但外壳太厚了
but the plating was too thick.

54
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,680
如果想进去  只能缩小  钻过分子间隙
The only way in was to shrink between the molecules.

55
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:30,920
我钻不透
I can't get through.

56
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:33,360
汉克
Hank.

57
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,770
我们都清楚  如果缩小到那个程度
We both knew that if you go that small

58
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:38,540
就回不来了
there is no coming back.

59
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:43,980
本该是我去的  但我的调节器坏了
It should have been me, but my regulator was damaged.

60
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:46,480
你妈妈的还完好
Your mother's wasn't.

61
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:50,200
告诉霍普我爱她
Tell Hope I love her.

62
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:52,180
她关掉了它
She turned it off.

63
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:53,370
珍妮特  不要
Janet. No!

64
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:56,170
进入了亚原子状态好拆弹
She went subatomic to deactivate the bomb.

65
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,500
你母亲那天拯救了上千人的性命
Your mother saved thousands of lives that day

66
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:08,500
尽管她知道  她会迷失在量子域中
knowing she'd be lost in the quantum realm.

67
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,770
孤身一人
Alone.

68
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:12,360
充满恐惧
Afraid.

69
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:14,360
永远迷失
Gone forever.

70
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,740
告诉你她再不能回家
Telling you that she wasn't coming home

71
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,620
是我这辈子做过的最难的事
was the hardest thing that I ever had to do.

72
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,800
但后来斯科特出现了
But then Scott showed up.

73
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:45,200
或者该说  他闯进了我们家
Or should I say, broke into our house.

74
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:48,770
他进入量子域后
And when he went to the quantum realm...

75
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,510
却又回来了
and came back.

76
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:55,350
一切都变了
Everything changed.

77
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,100
我开始想
I started to wonder...

78
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,110
或许你妈妈还活着
could your mother still be alive?

79
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,610
所以我翻出了一些旧图纸
So, I dusted off some old plans.

80
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:17,890
爸爸  你是什么意思
Dad, what are you saying?

81
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:22,590
我们或许能救她回来
I think it's possible to bring her back.

82
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:03,970
好  我们进来了
Okay. We're in.

83
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:09,080
这地方就是个迷宫
Oh, this place is a maze.

84
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:10,500
地图呢
Where's that map?

85
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,000
我们绝对接近了
We're definitely close.

86
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:17,940
-准备好了吗  -好了  爸爸
- You ready? - I'm ready, Daddy.

87
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,880
确定吗  等我们进去了
Are you sure? 'Cause once we're inside,

88
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,390
如果你迟疑或害怕  我们就死定了
you show any hesitation or fear, we're done.

89
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:24,570
我拿恐惧当早餐吃
I eat fear for breakfast.

90
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:26,630
这太酷了
That is super cool.

91
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:27,880
来吧
Come on.

92
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:35,660
看  是安东  他会给我们指路的
Look! It's Anton. He'll show us the way.

93
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:37,500
安东  我们走哪边
Anton, which way do we go?

94
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,270
安东  我们走哪边
Anton, which way do we go?

95
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,210
谢谢  安东
Thanks, Anton!

96
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:56,050
看啊  蚂蚁打通进了科技设施
Look, the ants have burrowed into the tech facility.

97
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:58,090
不  激光
Oh no, lasers!

98
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:02,190
我好像碰到了激光
I think I got lased!

99
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,450
秘密宝库
The secret vault.

100
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,570
你带隐形眼镜来了吧
Tell me you brought the contact lens.

101
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:10,320
带了
Yup.

102
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,740
完美  对准那里
Perfect! Right there.

103
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,600
找到了  是微宝藏
There! It's the micro-treasure!

104
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:23,120
我的奖杯
My trophy?

105
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:25,360
看上去像宝藏
It looks like treasure.

106
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,650
对我来说是的
Oh, it is to me.

107
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,390
我想拿去做展示说明
I want to take it to show-and-tell.

108
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:29,600
那不行
Oh, no, you can't do that.

109
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:31,700
不行  它绝不能离开这栋房子
You can't. It never leaves the house.

110
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:32,800
它太重要了
It's too important.

111
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,220
这是你给我的最棒的生日礼物
This is the best birthday present you ever got me.

112
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,100
我觉得好感动
I'm so touched

113
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,990
你认为我是世界上最棒的奶奶
you think I'm the world's greatest grandma.

114
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:39,850
他们只有这一个了
It was the only one they had.

115
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,700
让我好想给你织件毛衣
It makes me want to knit you a sweater.

116
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,100
不  是条子
Oh, no, the fuzz!

117
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,050
斯科特
Hey, Scotty...

118
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:48,500
我在看卡拉佩特安大楼的图纸
I was looking at the schematics for the Karapetyan buildings...

119
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,390
我觉得我们装了太多的监控摄像头
and I think we have way too many security cameras, don't we?

120
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:52,650
完全没有
No, no, not at all.

121
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:54,260
因为  摄像头真的好多
I mean, 'cause it's a lot of security cameras.

122
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:55,300
我知道他需要什么
I know what he needs.

123
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:57,020
我们公司的安保专家是谁啊
Who's the security expert in our business?

124
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:58,650
是你  但经营公司的是我
You are, but I'm running the company, right?

125
00:05:58,650 --> 00:05:59,250
如果我们开价太高
And if we overquote him...

126
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:00,130
他会去别家的
he's gonna go somewhere else.

127
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:01,390
我们一定要让这只大鸟到手
I mean, we gotta land this bird.

128
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:02,600
他不会去别家的
He ain't goin' anywhere.

129
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,050
而且那句俗语是"大鱼到手"
And the expression is "Land this fish."

130
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:05,730
不  是"大鸟到手"
No, it's "Land the bird."

131
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:06,880
就像"飞机到站"嘛
Just like you land the plane.

132
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,800
你得"飞机到站"才能维系生意
You gotta land the plane to be in business.

133
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,250
我知道纠结这种事挺傻的
I know it's silly to get hung up on these kinds of things,

134
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,290
-但我就这样  -鱼怎么能到手
- but I do. - How am I gonna land a fish?

135
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:14,480
它又不能走  如果它游上岸
It can't walk. And if it swam up on shore

136
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,740
跟鹰打一架  谁会赢
and it battled a hawk, who's gonna win?

137
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,250
这件事我真被你说服了
You've really turned me around on this thing.

138
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,220
没事  我们会把卡拉佩特安拿到手的
It's okay. We're gonna land Karapetyan.

139
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:23,310
失陪了
Now, if you just excuse me

140
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,320
我正在跟女儿偷东西呢
I'm in the middle of trying to steal something with my daughter.

141
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,430
我去重查一遍
I'm gonna go recheck it.

142
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,950
去找跑路蚁
To the escape ant!

143
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:32,870
趁条子还没回来  我们赶紧跑
Let's bounce before the po-po come back!

144
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:35,500
条子  这些词你都哪学的
The po-po? How do you even know that?

145
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,280
飞吧  安托瓦内特  飞吧
Let's fly, Antoinette! Let's fly!

146
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:50,270
硬着陆
Crash landing!

147
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:55,990
真希望我们能真缩小
I wish we could shrink for real.

148
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:57,380
那是挺酷的
That is pretty cool.

149
00:06:58,030 --> 00:06:59,500
我去办公室了  斯科特
I'm headed to the office, Scotty.

150
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,130
抱歉我之前抓狂了
And sorry about freaking out earlier, you know.

151
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:02,330
但我觉得我好多了
But I feel like I'm way better.

152
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:04,630
我的心绝对跳得太快了
My heart is definitely beating way too hard and stuff.

153
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:05,590
我的手也在抖
And my hands are shaking.

154
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:07,080
但应该跟这没关系的吧
But I think it's unrelated, you know?

155
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,350
肯定很棒的  路易斯
It's gonna be great, Luis!

156
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:09,350
你完全不用担心
You got nothing to worry about!

157
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:12,020
是啊  我是老大  我最棒了
Yeah, yeah. I'm the boss. I'm the boss.

158
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,840
我最厉害  好好好
I'm the boss. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

159
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:15,070
爸爸
Daddy!

160
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:23,500
拜托  吴  我只剩三天了
Come on, Woo! I've got three days left.

161
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,830
我为什么要企图逃跑
Why would I try to escape?

162
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:26,490
抱歉  斯科特  规矩就是规矩
Sorry, Scott, but rules are rules.

163
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:28,350
你触发了边界警报  我们就搜屋
You trip the perimeter alarm, we search the place.

164
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:29,960
角角落落都得搜到
Keel to stern, soup to nuts.

165
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:31,810
谢谢
Thank you.

166
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:34,070
就是个意外  我的脚穿透了栅栏
It was an accident. My foot went through the fence.

167
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:35,600
我们的飞蚁硬着陆了
Our flying ant crashed.

168
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,830
你试试在不能出屋的情况下
Hey, you try and entertain a 10-year-old

169
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:39,210
逗一个10岁小孩
when you can't leave the house.

170
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:40,950
知道我多努力吗
You know the lengths that I've gone to?

171
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,050
近景魔术
Close-up magic.

172
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:48,240
我学的
I learned that.

173
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,070
你为什么就不能放过我爸爸
Why can't you just leave my daddy alone?

174
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:53,350
凯西
Oh, Cassie.

175
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:55,570
这一切一定让你觉得像是
This must all seem like a bunch of

176
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:57,990
令人困惑的大人的事吧
confusing grown-up stuff to you, huh?

177
00:07:58,150 --> 00:07:59,730
这么想吧
Well, think of it this way.

178
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:01,530
你们学校有校规吧
Your school has rules, right?

179
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:03,900
比如  不能在墙上乱涂乱画
Like, you can't draw on the walls.

180
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:05,610
你爸爸去了德国
Well, your daddy went to Germany

181
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,900
跟美国队长在墙上乱涂乱画来着
and drew on the walls with Captain America.

182
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:10,160
这违反了《索科威亚协议》
And that was a violation of Article 16,

183
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,650
第16款第三条
Paragraph Three of the Sokovia Accords.

184
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:14,610
按照他与国土安全部
Now, as a part of his joint plea deal

185
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:16,800
和德国政府签订的联合认罪协议
with Homeland Security and the German government

186
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:18,720
他可以回到美国
he was allowed to return to the U.S

187
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:21,220
前提是他服两年的软禁刑期
provided he serve two years under house arrest

188
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:23,180
和三年的假释
followed by three years of probation.

189
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:26,200
且不得擅自行动或使用未获批设备
And avoid any unauthorized activities, technology

190
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,360
或接触任何曾经
or contact with any former associates

191
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,610
或正在违反前述协议或任何相关法规的
who were or currently are in violation of said Accords.

192
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:33,590
旧同伙
Or any related statutes.

193
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:34,680
懂了吗  亲爱的
Okay, sweetie?

194
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:38,300
你还真会带小孩
You're really great with kids.

195
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:40,230
谢谢  我兼职做青年牧师的
Thanks. I'm also a youth pastor.

196
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:43,070
总之  不是我包打听
Anyway, not to be a Johnny ask-a-lot

197
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:44,380
但你最近没联系过
but you haven't had any contact

198
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:46,390
汉克·皮姆和霍普·凡·戴恩吧
with Hank Pym or Hope Van Dyne, have you?

199
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:47,960
-没有  -真的吗
- No. - You sure?

200
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,050
因为我们迟早会抓到他们
Because it's only a matter of time before we get 'em.

201
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:52,750
那是他们的设备  所以他们也违反了协议
It was their tech, so they violated the Accords, too.

202
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,900
跟他们有联系是违反你的认罪协议的
And associating with them breaks your deal.

203
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:57,290
不用我提醒你
And, uh, I don't need to remind you

204
00:08:57,290 --> 00:08:59,510
若对认罪协议有丝毫违反
that any violation of your agreement

205
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:01,780
就是至少20年的监狱刑期
means 20 years in prison. Minimum.

206
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:04,210
我好久没跟汉克和霍普联系过了
I haven't talked to Hank or Hope in forever.

207
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,490
他们恨死他了
They hate his guts.

208
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:06,610
谢谢  小花生
Thanks, peanut.

209
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:09,490
你怎么做到的  斯科特
How'd you do it, Scott?

210
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:10,890
做什么
Do what?

211
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:13,640
纸牌戏法
The card trick.

212
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,770
不是吧
Seriously?

213
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:18,080
天呐
Oh, my God!

214
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:21,110
你们不能高兴了就跑来
You people can't just show up here whenever you want

215
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:22,380
然后搜查这里
and search the place.

216
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:23,470
其实  他们可以的
Actually, they can.

217
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:24,400
你需要搜查令
You need a warrant.

218
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,510
其实  他们不需要
Actually, they don't.

219
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:26,410
真的吗
Really?

220
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:29,630
带足球鞋了吗
Did you pack your soccer shoes?

221
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:31,080
-嗯  -好
- Yeah. - All right.

222
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:34,930
下次我再见你  就是在外面了
Next time I see you will be on the outside.

223
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:35,800
好
All right.

224
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,030
我也要抱抱
Get on the inside of this.

225
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:41,280
三天了  真的
Hey, three days. Seriously...

226
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,700
-为你骄傲  哥们  -谢谢
- I'm proud of you, bud. - Thank you.

227
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:43,940
知道吗  再来一个
You know what? Give me another one.

228
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:46,540
我也是  天呐  自由
Me too! Gosh! Freedom!

229
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:49,230
新生意  我觉得你前途无量
New business! I am sensing greatness.

230
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:50,900
我这周末很开心  爸爸
I had a fun weekend, Daddy.

231
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:53,050
我也是  小花生  等下周末的
Me too, peanut. But just wait till next weekend.

232
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:55,460
等我能出屋了  我们要出去疯玩
Once I'm outta here, you and I are gonna go paint this town red.

233
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:58,260
我们要吃一大堆冰淇淋  然后吐个不停
We'll have so much ice cream, we'll never stop puking.

234
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:07,850
你越来越厉害了
You're gettin' good at that.

235
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:08,490
怎么做到的
How'd you do that?

236
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:10,450
-再见  爸爸  -再见
- Bye, Daddy. - Bye.

237
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:13,980
-再见  -再见
- Bye. - Bye.

238
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,400
三天
Three days.

239
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:20,300
轻松
Easy-peasy.

240
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:31,960
打指响  让他们看这边
Snap your fingers. That gets them to look over there.

241
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:33,770
这叫做误导
And that is misdirection.

242
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:38,470
我们曾梦想
We had a dream

243
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:40,680
会一起去旅行
We'd go travelin' together

244
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:44,170
我们散播一点爱意  然后继续向前
We'd spread a little lovin' then we'd keep movin' on

245
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,310
轻松
Easy-peasy.

246
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:24,570
你在哪
Where are you?

247
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,110
你所知的一切
Everything that you know...

248
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:39,460
迷失在
Lost...

249
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,250
量子域里
in the quantum realm.

250
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:50,410
什么
What?

251
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:53,980
我要找到你  小糖豆
I'm gonna find you, Jellybean.

252
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:00,720
我找到你了
I found you!

253
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:03,580
你总能找到我  妈妈
You always find me, Mommy.

254
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,850
怎么回事
What the hell?

255
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:22,730
汉克  好久没联系了
Hank! It's been a while.

256
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:27,430
我都不知道这是否还是你的号码
I don't even know if this is your number anymore.

257
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:30,820
我可能是你最不想联系的人了
And I'm probably the last person you wanna hear from. But

258
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:33,960
但我刚做了个特奇怪的梦
I just had a really weird dream.

259
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:36,580
我知道这听上去不像是什么急事
And I know that doesn't sound like an emergency or anything...

260
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:40,270
但感觉特别真实
but it just felt very real.

261
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:42,950
我又回到了量子域
I was back in the quantum realm...

262
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:47,080
我觉得我看到了你妻子
and I think I saw your wife.

263
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,740
然后我变成你妻子了
And then I was your wife.

264
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:53,130
不是什么奇怪的意思
I mean, not in a weird way or anything.

265
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:57,230
其实  我这么说出来
You know, hearing this out loud,

266
00:12:57,230 --> 00:12:59,920
我开始觉得  这事真不急
I'm thinking, uh, it's not an emergency.

267
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,320
抱歉打扰你了
I'm sorry to bother you.

268
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:04,930
我对很多事都感到抱歉
I'm sorry for a lot of things.

269
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:17,980
就是说  我手指甲上的一颗小原子
That means, one tiny atom in my fingernail

270
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:20,130
-就可能...  -可能是个
- could be... - Could be one, little,

271
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:23,100
小宇宙
tiny universe.

272
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:58,100
霍普
Hope?

273
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,820
这又是梦吗
Is this another dream?

274
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:02,780
你觉得那是梦吗
Do you think it was a dream

275
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:05,610
还是说你真有可能在那里看到了我妈妈
or is it possible that you really saw my mom down there?

276
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,610
我不确定
I'm not sure.

277
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:12,520
我不能在这儿
I can't be here!

278
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,570
我不能在这儿  我在服软禁刑期
I can't be here! I'm under house arrest!

279
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:17,500
系统运行时是打不开的  斯科特
They won't open while the system's engaged, Scott.

280
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:39,770
你得带我回家  他们随时可能会上门
You have to take me home. They could show up any second!

281
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:41,590
放松  就你的保姆警察所知
Relax. As far as your nanny cops know,

282
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:42,750
你还在家呢
you're still at home.

283
00:14:56,590 --> 00:14:57,480
斯科特
Scotty?

284
00:14:57,690 --> 00:15:00,030
他已被编程好复制你的日常活动
He's programmed to replicate your daily routine.

285
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:01,170
九小时睡觉
Nine hours in bed.

286
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:02,530
五小时看电视
Five hours in front of the TV.

287
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:04,930
两小时泡在厕所  不管是为啥
Two hours in the bathroom, whatever that's about.

288
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,600
这根本不准确
That's totally inaccurate.

289
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:08,310
你怎么会知道我的日常活动
And how do you know about my daily routine?

290
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:09,220
你在监视我吗
Are you spying on me?

291
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:11,120
我们注意一切安全隐患
We keep tabs on all security threats, all right?

292
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,180
而目前为止  你是最大的一个
And so far the biggest one we've had is you.

293
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,760
德国的事我很抱歉  是他们跑来找我
I'm sorry about Germany. They just showed up.

294
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:21,290
还说事关国家安全
They said it was a matter of national security.

295
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:22,310
美队需要帮助  所以...
That Cap needed help, so...

296
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:23,100
美队
Cap?

297
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:27,440
...国队长  美国队长  美队
Tain America. Captain. Cap.

298
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,600
我们就这么喊他
It's what we call him.

299
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:30,900
朋友之间
If you're a friend.

300
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,190
我倒不是说我算是朋友...算是吧
I'm not saying I'm a friend of... A little,

301
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,880
我认识他  他人挺好  不说了
I know him. He's nice. Whatever.

302
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:36,800
对不起  好吗  我没想到我会被抓
I'm sorry! All right? I didn't think I'd get caught.

303
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,470
你没想的事多了
You didn't think about a lot of things.

304
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:40,700
汉克怎么样
How's Hank?

305
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:41,680
我们还在逃跑
We're still running.

306
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,320
房子没了  我们的自由也没了
The house is gone, so is our freedom.

307
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,500
你觉得他会怎么样
How do you think he is?

308
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:46,750
对不起  我知道你生我气
I'm sorry. I know you're mad.

309
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,320
我要的不是道歉  斯科特
I'm not looking for an apology, Scott.

310
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,670
我之所以还跟你说话
The only reason why we're even talking

311
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:51,640
是因为我们需要你脑子里的东西
is because we need what's in your head.

312
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:31,520
这是你们住的地方吗
Is this where you're living?

313
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:36,990
如果你们需要帮助或钱  或许我可以...
If you need help or money or something, maybe I can...

314
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:37,930
不用
We're fine.

315
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:38,060
汉克  听着  我只想...
Hank. Look, I just wanna...

316
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:39,030
省省吧
Save it!

317
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:44,290
-可以开始了吗  -嗯
- Can we start? - Yeah.

318
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:47,890
你在家放松的时候
So, while you were relaxing at home

319
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:49,380
我们建了这个
we were building this.

320
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,370
是个隧道  通往量子域
It's a tunnel. To the quantum realm.

321
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,350
去找我妈妈
To my mom.

322
00:17:55,730 --> 00:17:57,020
我们认为她可能还在那里
We think she might still be down there.

323
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:58,170
但我们不知道在哪
We just don't know where.

324
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:58,970
什么
What?

325
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,570
如果我们能定位出我妈的位置
If we can pinpoint my mom's location...

326
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:03,370
那我就能开驾驶舱去救她
then the pod can take me down to get her.

327
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:04,310
你们建造了这一切
You built all this

328
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:06,400
却都不能确定她是不是还活着吗
and you don't even know if she's alive?

329
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,460
这叫假设
It's called a hypothesis.

330
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:11,180
昨晚我们第一次启动了隧道
Last night, we powered up the tunnel for the first time.

331
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:13,300
但过载  于是关停了
It was overloaded and it shut down.

332
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,950
但就在那一瞬间
But for a split second,

333
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:18,630
通往量子域的大门被打开了
the doorway to the quantum realm was opened.

334
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:20,080
然后呢
And?

335
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:23,580
五分钟后  你打了来  说起了我妈妈
And five minutes later, you called, talking about Mom.

336
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,060
我们认为你去那下面时
We think when you were down there,

337
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:26,860
可能跟她发生了纠缠
you may have entangled with her.

338
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:27,750
汉克  我绝不会那么做的
Hank, I would never do that.

339
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,090
我是尊重你的
I respect you too much.

340
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:31,600
量子纠缠  斯科特
Quantum entanglement, Scott.

341
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,390
我们认为她可能
We think she might have

342
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:34,430
在你脑袋里放了信息
put some kind of a message in your head.

343
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:36,030
希望是个位置信息
Hopefully, a location.

344
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:37,980
打开隧道时  信息被触发了
And opening the tunnel triggered it.

345
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:39,740
你妈妈在我脑袋里留了信息
Your mom put a message in my head?

346
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:41,540
拜托  这疯了
Come on. That's insane.

347
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:42,690
不  斯科特
No, Scott.

348
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:43,730
疯狂
Insane

349
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:47,680
是不告诉我们就跑去德国跟复仇者联盟打架
is going to Germany without telling us, and fighting the Avengers.

350
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:51,110
告诉我  关于你偷的战衣  你没撒谎
Just tell me you weren't lying about the suit you took.

351
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:53,760
告诉我你确实销毁了它
Tell me you really destroyed it.

352
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,180
是的  我销毁了它  我发誓
I did, I destroyed it, I swear.

353
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:58,650
我真不敢相信你销毁了我的战衣
I can't believe you destroyed my suit!

354
00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:00,950
那可是我的毕生心血
That was my life's work!

355
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:02,230
我还能怎么办
What was I supposed to do?

356
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:04,940
你就不该偷走我的战衣
You were supposed to not take my suit!

357
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:06,310
对不起  汉克
I'm sorry, Hank!

358
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:07,670
对不起我偷走了战衣
I'm sorry I took the suit.

359
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:09,610
对不起我昨晚打了电话
I'm sorry that I called last night.

360
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,290
我不记得在下面见过珍妮特
I don't remember seeing Janet down there.

361
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:13,560
我也希望我见过
I wish that I did.

362
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,370
我就是梦到了她
I just had a dream about her

363
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:16,330
跟一个小姑娘玩捉迷藏
playing hide-and-seek with a little girl.

364
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:20,430
什么
What?

365
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:24,780
我做了个梦
I had a dream.

366
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:27,670
她在跟个小姑娘玩捉迷藏
She was playing hide-and-seek with a little girl.

367
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:29,540
凯西和我以前常玩的
Cassie and I do it all the time.

368
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:30,860
没什么意义
Doesn't mean anything.

369
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:33,050
但梦里的是凯西吗
But was it Cassie in the dream?

370
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:34,090
不是
No.

371
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:35,720
她藏在了哪里
Where was she hiding?

372
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:37,110
-什么  -那个小姑娘
- What? - The little girl.

373
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:39,260
她藏在了哪里  大衣柜吗
Where was she hiding? Was it in a wardrobe?

374
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:42,510
不是  是个很大的柜子
No, it was in a tall dresser.

375
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:43,810
就是大衣柜咯
You mean a wardrobe.

376
00:19:43,810 --> 00:19:45,010
是这么叫的吗
Is that what that's called?

377
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:46,690
什么颜色的
What color was it?

378
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:48,360
红的
Red.

379
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:52,260
上面有小马吗
Were there horses on it?

380
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:53,690
天呐
Oh, boy.

381
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:58,090
我们玩时  我每次都藏在那里
It's where I hid every time that we played.

382
00:19:58,590 --> 00:19:59,480
听上去
It doesn't sound like

383
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,700
你没太理解这游戏的要义
you really got the gist of the game.

384
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:04,740
她还活着
She's alive.

385
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,140
我就知道
I knew it.

386
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,660
我就知道
I knew it!

387
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:13,580
我们得拿到那个部件
We need to get that part.

388
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:14,490
好
Okay.

389
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,080
我们越早让隧道正常运作
The sooner we get the tunnel working...

390
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,910
就能越早从他脑袋里提取到信息
the sooner we can get this message out of his head.

391
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:20,900
伯奇拿到了吗
Does Burch have it?

392
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:22,510
-是的  我们走  -什么部件
- Yeah. Let's go. - What part?

393
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:25,010
伯奇是谁  等等  什么情况啊
Who's Burch? Wait. What's happening?

394
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:26,980
我们需要一个部件
We need a component

395
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:29,100
来防止隧道再次过载
to stop the tunnel from overloading again.

396
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,520
我帮你拿了衣服  你最好换一下
I grabbed your clothes. You might want to change.

397
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,510
听着  我也想帮你们
Look, I'd really like to help you...

398
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:47,080
但如果他们来给我摘脚环时我不在家
but if I'm not at home when they come to take off my ankle monitor

399
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,410
那我就要蹲一辈子了
then I'm going away forever.

400
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:50,610
等我们拿到了部件  启动了隧道
Once we get the component and power up the tunnel

401
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:52,680
就能拿到信息  你午饭前就能回到家
we'll get the message, and have you home by lunch.

402
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:55,140
我们得快点  纠缠不会维持太久
We have to hurry. The entanglement won't last.

403
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:56,340
你欠我们的
You owe us.

404
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:58,880
好吧  我能不能进去等
All right, fine. But can I just wait inside?

405
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,570
因为我不该在外面的
Because I'm not supposed to be out here.

406
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,540
走吧
Let's go.

407
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:30,850
-没问题吧  -嗯
- We good? - Yeah.

408
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:31,780
我就回来
I'll be right back.

409
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:41,630
-我能吃个吗  -不能
- Can I have one of these? - No.

410
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:59,670
苏珊  欢迎来到好餐厅
Susan! Welcome to Oui!

411
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:00,330
桑尼
Sonny!

412
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,730
"好"是法语"是"的意思
Oui is French for "Yes."

413
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:05,920
立意就是  是从农场直接上餐桌的本地好料
As in "Yes" to farm-to-table, "Yes" to locally sourced...

414
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,310
是把生态摆在利益之前的好策略
and "Yes" to planet before profit.

415
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:11,210
那希望"你是否拿到了
Well, let's hope it also means "Yes"

416
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:13,130
我订购的部件"的答案也是"是"
to "Do you have the component I ordered?"

417
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:17,720
我一向喜欢你的幽默感  苏珊
You know, I have always loved your sense of humor, Susan.

418
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:18,750
请坐
Have a seat.

419
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:19,900
不用了  谢谢
No, I'm good. Thank you.

420
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:21,050
这人是谁
Who is this guy?

421
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:24,690
桑尼·伯奇  黑市科技走私贩
Sonny Burch. He traffics in black market technology.

422
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:27,370
他为我们取得了建造隧道需要的材料
He's been getting us what we need to build the tunnel.

423
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:30,570
能给我一个...
Could I just have one...

424
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:31,800
不能
No.

425
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:36,510
我在联调局有个特别的朋友
You know, I have a special friend at the FBI.

426
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:38,100
我说"特别"是因为
And I say "Special" because,

427
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:41,840
他会告诉我些我原本不知道的事
well, he tells me things that I didn't previously know.

428
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:43,670
比如说
For example...

429
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,290
你名字不叫苏珊
your name isn't Susan.

430
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,420
而是霍普·凡·戴恩
It's Hope Van Dyne.

431
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:51,870
而你背后的同伙是你父亲  汉克·皮姆
And your unseen associate, that's your father, Hank Pym.

432
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,140
-这可不妙  汉克  -还用你说
- That's not good, Hank. - No shit.

433
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:03,440
你想要什么
What do you want?

434
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:06,180
关系是建立在信任上的  霍普
Relationships are built on trust, Hope.

435
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:09,040
我希望我们的关系有坚实的基础
And I want our relationship to have a strong foundation.

436
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,250
我们的关系
Our relationship?

437
00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:12,840
我的市场在变化  霍普
My business landscape has been shifting, Hope.

438
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:15,290
神盾局和九头蛇都不存在了
Hell, S.H.I.E.L.D. and HYDRA don't even exist anymore...

439
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:16,530
但汉克·皮姆呢
but now, Hank Pym...

440
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:19,700
汉克·皮姆是个好机会
Hank Pym is a real opportunity.

441
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:20,830
你到底想说什么
Do you have a point?

442
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:21,840
你以为我不知道
Oh, you think that I don't know

443
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,730
你要这些是在建造什么吗
what you've been building with all this?

444
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,710
量子科技
Quantum technology.

445
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:29,880
什么纳米科技啊  人工智能啊
Now, you can forget nanotech, forget AI,

446
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,120
加密货币都过时了
forget cryptocurrency.

447
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,990
量子科技才是未来
Quantum energy is the future.

448
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:34,890
是下一阵淘金热
It's the next gold rush.

449
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:35,610
是吗
Is that so?

450
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:36,840
我要加入  霍普
I want in, Hope.

451
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:40,160
所以  出于好意  我已经擅自
So, as a gesture of good will, I have taken the liberty

452
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,530
为你的实验室安排了买家
of arranging some buyers for your lab.

453
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:44,000
起价
Starting bid

454
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:47,810
是十亿美金
one billion dollars.

455
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:49,590
谢谢  桑尼  真的
Thank you, Sonny, really.

456
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,740
但我父亲和我有件
But my father and I have something

457
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:53,570
比成立公司要更紧急的事
slightly more pressing than starting a business.

458
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:56,560
所以我还是按说好的拿走部件
So I'll just take the component as arranged.

459
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:59,060
我的买家不接受拒绝
My buyers don't take no for an answer.

460
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,420
所以  我们要么一起做生意
So, we are either in business together

461
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:04,670
要么就不做生意了
or we aren't in business together.

462
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,450
那就不做吧
Then I guess we aren't.

463
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:11,030
你可以走
You can go.

464
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:14,250
但你的钱恐怕得留下
But I'm afraid your money's gonna have to remain.

465
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:17,940
就当是赔偿我受伤的感情
Let's call it compensation for my injured feelings.

466
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:20,020
听着  桑尼
Listen, Sonny.

467
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:22,860
如果你痛快把部件给我
This is gonna be so much easier on everybody

468
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:24,590
对大家都会简单得多
if you just give me that component.

469
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:26,640
亲爱的  你唯一可以拿走的
Darlin', the only thing you're takin' from here...

470
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:30,100
就是我的心  但它会渐渐愈合的
is my heart, but it will mend in time.

471
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:33,030
好吧
Okay.

472
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:42,520
现在怎么办
So, now what?

473
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:43,920
等着瞧
You'll see.

474
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,270
她说她和她爸有什么要紧事
She said her and her daddy had something pressing.

475
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:48,240
我要知道是什么事
I want to know what it is

476
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:49,670
因为如果他们没在跟我们合作
because if they're not working with us

477
00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:50,920
就肯定在跟别人合作
they're working with somebody.

478
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:52,460
去查明  我要知道名字
So find out. I want some names...

479
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:58,910
等等  你给她加了翅膀
Hold on, you gave her wings?

480
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:05,950
抓到她
Get her.

481
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,300
别打碎我的世纪之交大吊灯
Not my turn-of-the-century chandelier!

482
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:30,380
别开枪了  住手
Stop firing! Stop!

483
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,530
好吧  拿上这个  快走
All right, take this. Go. Go, go, go!

484
00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:37,170
快走
Go!

485
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:41,880
翅膀还有爆能枪
Wings and blasters.

486
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:44,110
看来我那时候这技术还没开发好咯
So I take it you didn't have that tech available for me.

487
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:45,240
开发好了
No, I did.

488
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:49,070
很高兴跟你做生意  桑尼
It was a pleasure doing business with you, Sonny.

489
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:52,040
我们的事还没完呢  霍普
Oh, our business isn't finished yet, Hope.

490
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,960
我可以向你保证
I can assure you of that!

491
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,920
那是什么
What in the hell is that?

492
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,220
爸爸  你看到了吗
Dad, are you seeing this?

493
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:19,800
霍普  快跑
Hope, get out of there!

494
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:29,930
-我得做点什么  -等等
- I gotta do something. - Wait!

495
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:37,450
还没完成
It is still a work in progress.

496
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,410
那一踢是你教我的  记得吗
You taught me that kick. Remember?

497
00:27:58,410 --> 00:27:59,640
嗯  姿势很棒
Yeah, great form.

498
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,570
想当年啊  我们是怎么了
Those were the days. Whatever happened to us?

499
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:03,240
不是时候  斯科特
Not the time, Scott.

500
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:04,700
该死  它哪去了
Damn it, where'd it go?

501
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,230
我跟丢了
I've lost it.

502
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:10,750
蚂蚁摄像头上什么都看不到
I'm not seeing anything on the ant cams.

503
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:11,650
去看看...
Try looking...

504
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:13,580
爸爸
Dad?

505
00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:23,670
把那个给我
Give me that.

506
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:24,740
快点
Now.

507
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,640
-你没事吧  -有事
- Are you okay? - No!

508
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:31,900
他拿了实验室
He got the lab.

509
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:33,130
-不  -快走
- No. - Come on!

510
00:28:36,370 --> 00:28:37,320
那是什么
What was that?

511
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:38,810
我不知道
I don't know.

512
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:40,690
但我们得找个地方重新部署
But we need to find somewhere to regroup

513
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:42,520
并查明实验室在哪
and figure out where the lab is.

514
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:44,600
现在去哪
So, where to now?

515
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,410
我家吧
How about my house?

516
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,020
我反正也该在那儿的
I'm supposed to be there anyway,

517
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:48,880
吴随时都可能到
and Woo could walk in any second.

518
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,790
所以我们绝不能去你家
Exactly why we're not going to your house.

519
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:52,990
那你家呢
What about your house?

520
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:54,930
抱歉
Sorry.

521
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:58,650
那我只能想到一个地方了
Well, there is one place I can think of.

522
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:00,670
不
No.

523
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,410
不不
No, no, no, no!

524
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:06,230
不
No!

525
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:10,720
皮姆博士
Dr. Pym

526
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,180
谁能想到
like, who would've thought that,

527
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:14,040
您再次在危难时刻
once again, in your hour of need

528
00:29:14,050 --> 00:29:15,640
找到了我们
that you would turn to us, you know?

529
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:17,270
我是没想到
Not me.

530
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:19,040
自便
Help yourself.

531
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,800
干吗买这么高档的点心
What's up with the fancy pastry?

532
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,120
我们得控制食物预算
We gotta keep the food budget down.

533
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:24,180
那我们早餐该吃什么
Well, what are we supposed to have for breakfast?

534
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,450
燕麦片
The oatmeal packets.

535
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:26,920
燕麦片
Oatmeal packets.

536
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,630
-这是侮辱  -怎么是侮辱了
- It's insult. - Why is it an insult?

537
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:29,720
因为那味道像沙子
Because it tastes like sand.

538
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,350
知道为什么吗  因为那是有机食品
You know why? 'Cause it's organic.

539
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,720
不是有机食品  是沙子
It's not organic, it's sand.

540
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,840
那可是一天最重要的一餐
It's the most important meal of the day.

541
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,000
你可以随意发挥嘛
You know what, you can get creative with it.

542
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:35,730
能硌断牙
Break teeth.

543
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:37,780
撒点红糖  撒点肉桂
Put a little brown sugar on it. You can put some cinnamon.

544
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:38,290
倒点蜂蜜
Put a little honey.

545
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:40,430
-随心所欲  -伙计们
- Whatever you want... - Guys, guys, guys.

546
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,690
干什么啊
Come on, man.

547
00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:43,640
我们还有更要紧的事呢
We got bigger fish to fry.

548
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:44,870
那是我的桌子吗
Is that my desk?

549
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:47,180
-是的  -什么
- Yeah. - What?

550
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:48,570
为什么我的桌子那么小
Why do I have such a small desk?

551
00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:50,120
因为我们选桌子时你又不在
Because you weren't there when we were choosing desks.

552
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,340
打瞌睡  没得选
You snooze, you lose.

553
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:52,510
我在被软禁啊
Well, I was under house arrest.

554
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:53,060
是啊
Yeah.

555
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:54,450
知道吗  这都算不上是桌子
You know what, this isn't even a desk.

556
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:55,450
这是垃圾
This is garbage.

557
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:58,130
你们是在外面的垃圾里找来的
You found this outside amongst garbage.

558
00:29:58,130 --> 00:29:59,410
是在旧物义卖上淘来的
I got it at a rummage sale.

559
00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:01,120
你就偏在我的桌子上省钱
So, you save money on my desk?

560
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:01,850
行了
Guys.

561
00:30:01,850 --> 00:30:04,440
霍普  拜托  我们得集中精神
Hope, please, we need to focus, all right?

562
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,840
我们得赶紧找到那个实验室  天呐
We gotta find that lab already. Jeez.

563
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:10,320
知道吗  我听说了你的遭遇
Oh, you know what? I heard stories, like what happened to you.

564
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:12,760
说有个吓人的家伙  能钻墙
This crazy, creepy cat, who walks through walls and stuff.

565
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,450
像个幽灵
Like a ghost.

566
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:16,190
像雅加婆婆
Like Baba Yaga.

567
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:21,110
雅加婆婆  女巫
Baba Yaga, the witch.

568
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:24,360
他们给小孩子讲故事吓唬他们
They tell stories to children to frighten them.

569
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,130
你知道雅加婆婆吗
You know Baba Yaga?

570
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,840
不管是谁偷的
Whoever stole it...

571
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:31,250
我们得找到它
we need to find it.

572
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:34,820
那样的人是找不到的  得等他们找你
Oh, you don't find someone like that. They find you.

573
00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:36,430
就像雅加婆婆
Like Baba Yaga.

574
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:39,610
皮姆博士  你是我认识的最聪明的天才
Dr. Pym, you're the smartest genius I know.

575
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:42,020
你没有在实验室上安装寻回系统吗
Didn't you put some kind of LoJack on your lab?

576
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:43,000
因为如果你没有
Because if you didn't,

577
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,310
我们这里有很多价钱公道的选择
we have a variety of affordable options.

578
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:47,330
我当然安装了  路易斯
Of course I did, Luis.

579
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:48,910
系统被解除了
It was disabled.

580
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:51,790
偷走实验室的人非常在行
Whoever stole the lab knew exactly what they were doing.

581
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:53,690
那人看上去好像还在变相
They also looked like they were phasing.

582
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:54,630
变相
Phasing?

583
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:55,770
量子变相
Quantum phasing.

584
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:58,100
就是物体在物质的各状态间变化
When an object moves through different states of matter.

585
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:59,920
是啊  我想的也是那个
Oh, yeah, that's what I was thinking.

586
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:01,250
实验室释放辐射
The lab emits radiation.

587
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:03,970
我们可以改造一台量子光谱仪追踪它吗
Can we modify a quantum spectrometer and track it?

588
00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:07,120
那是可行的  但我的设备都在实验室里
That could work, yes, but all my equipment is in the lab.

589
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:08,800
还有哪里有那样的设备
Where else can we find that equipment?

590
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:12,410
是有那么个人
Well, there is one person.

591
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:14,940
比尔·福斯特
Bill Foster.

592
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:15,630
好啊
Great!

593
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:17,250
那是谁
Who's Bill Foster?

594
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:20,140
他是我爸爸的一个老同事  神盾局的
He's an old colleague of my dad's, from S.H.I.E.L.D.

595
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,550
他们多年前就闹崩了
They had a falling out years ago.

596
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:23,780
你似乎经常跟人闹崩
You seem to have a lot of falling outs with people.

597
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,690
可能只是浪费时间
It's probably just a waste of time.

598
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:28,040
我光是在这里可就是赌上了一切
I'm risking everything by being here.

599
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,380
你不觉得我们该去问问吗
Don't you think we should check?

600
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:31,510
我们得查明是谁偷走了实验室
We need to find out who took the lab.

601
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:27,200
伙计们  这样暴露在外可不太好
Guys, it's not a good idea to be out in the open like this.

602
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:30,240
放松  没人会认出我们的
Relax, no one's gonna recognize us.

603
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:32,690
怎么  就因为帽子和墨镜吗
What, because of hats and sunglasses?

604
00:32:32,930 --> 00:32:34,400
这不叫伪装  汉克
That's not a disguise, Hank.

605
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,680
我们只是像看棒球赛的自己
We look like ourselves at a baseball game.

606
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:38,740
在独立系统中
In an isolated system...

607
00:32:38,970 --> 00:32:43,490
粒子以稳定相关系共存
particles co-exist in a stable phase relationship.

608
00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:45,670
如果系统受到干扰
If the system is interfered with,

609
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:49,040
稳定就会变成混乱
that stability becomes chaos.

610
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:50,590
不可预测
Unpredictable.

611
00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:53,370
危险  美妙
Dangerous. Beautiful.

612
00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:56,110
完全独立的量子系统
Isolated completely, a quantum system

613
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:58,760
将退回到物质的不同状态
would revert back to separate states of matter...

614
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:02,570
每一个都与其环境的独特状态纠缠
each entangled with a distinct state of its environment.

615
00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:03,850
也就是说
In other words,

616
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:07,060
这一物体将同时与多个平行现实
the object in question would be both in and out of phase

617
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:09,530
同相和异相
with multiple parallel realities.

618
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:18,170
说到跟现实不同步
Speaking of being out of phase with reality.

619
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:21,520
我注意到你们之中
I am noticing an unusually high number

620
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:23,960
有异常多的朦胧目光
of glazed eyes out there among you.

621
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:28,010
我们就提前几分钟结束吧
So, why don't we call it a few minutes early?

622
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:29,240
今天就到这儿吧
That'll be enough for today.

623
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,250
谢谢  女士们先生们  你们可以走了
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, you may go.

624
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:36,330
真是难以置信  你与珍妮特相连
It's incredible. You're linked to Janet.

625
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:39,150
这是你脑中波斯纳分子的各量子态
It's quantum entanglement between the quantum states of

626
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:41,040
之间的量子纠缠
Posner molecules in your brains.

627
00:33:41,330 --> 00:33:42,590
嗯  我也那么想的
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

628
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:46,050
你们是把"量子"一词加在每句话之前吗
Do you guys just put the word "quantum" in front of everything?

629
00:33:46,050 --> 00:33:47,780
博士  我们得找到我们的实验室
Doctor, we need to find our lab.

630
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:48,800
霍普  我也想帮你
Hope, I'd love to help you...

631
00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:50,640
但我并没有你说的那样的设备
but I don't have anything like the equipment you're describing.

632
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:53,160
我就说这是浪费时间  我们走吧
I told you this is a waste of time. Come on, let's go.

633
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,610
别瞧不起我  汉克
Don't condescend, Hank.

634
00:33:54,610 --> 00:33:56,560
是你在躲避联调局的追捕
You're the one who's on the run from the FBI.

635
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,520
就因为你非得把自己放大到
All because you had to grow to a size

636
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:00,560
与你的自大相配的尺寸
that finally fit your ego.

637
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:03,750
德国那个不是我  是这个白痴
That wasn't me in Germany. It was this idiot.

638
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:05,180
真的
Really?

639
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:08,360
变那么大肯定很累吧
Going that big, it must've been exhausting.

640
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:11,090
我之后整整睡了三天  你都无法想象
I slept for three days straight. You have no idea.

641
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:12,220
我能想象
Actually, I do.

642
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:15,030
想当年  我曾跟汉克搭档搞过一个项目
Back in the day, I was Hank's partner on a project called

643
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:15,860
歌利亚[巨人]
Goliath.

644
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:17,580
等等  你是我的搭档吗
Excuse me? You were my partner?

645
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:19,890
唯一比变那么大还累的
The only thing more tiring than going that big

646
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:21,810
就是忍受汉克的臭脾气
is putting up with Hank's bullshit.

647
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:22,780
是啊
Right...

648
00:34:24,850 --> 00:34:25,830
我不知道
I don't know.

649
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:27,600
你变得多大
How big did you get?

650
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,980
最高纪录是21英尺
My record? 21 feet.

651
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:31,380
-不赖啊  -你呢
- Not bad. - You?

652
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:32,880
算了
I don't...

653
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:34,310
不  真的  我很好奇
No, really, I'm curious.

654
00:34:34,970 --> 00:34:36,930
65英尺  是啊
65 feet. Yeah.

655
00:34:36,930 --> 00:34:38,180
-好大啊  -65英尺
- Huge. - 65.

656
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:40,700
如果你们俩比够大小了
If you two are finished comparing sizes...

657
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:43,720
我们得想办法追踪实验室
we need to figure out a way to track down the lab.

658
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:46,800
伟大的汉克·皮姆还没想到办法吗
And the great Hank Pym hasn't figured that one out yet?

659
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:47,770
奇怪啊
Strange.

660
00:34:48,390 --> 00:34:50,230
你想当年可是无所不知
You had all the answers back in the day.

661
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,790
所以我才离开了项目
That's why I left the project.

662
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:52,770
离开吗
Left?

663
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:55,340
-是我炒了你  -我最正确的决定
- I fired you. - Best decision I ever made.

664
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:57,560
汉克是个糟糕的搭档  脾气暴躁
Hank was a terrible partner. Temperamental...

665
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:59,390
固执  没耐心
stubborn, impatient.

666
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:01,860
他迟早会把所有人都推开
Sooner or later, he just pushed everyone away.

667
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:03,170
只是那些庸才
Just the mediocrities.

668
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:05,790
珍妮特是唯一受得了他
Janet was the only one who could endure him

669
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:06,990
并选择留下来的
and chose to stick it out.

670
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:07,830
小心点  比尔
Watch it, Bill.

671
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,620
但她为此付出了代价  是吧
She paid the price, though, didn't she?

672
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:10,630
你个混蛋
You son of a bitch.

673
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:12,930
我不是来这儿听你俩吵嘴的
I didn't come here to listen to you two squabble.

674
00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:14,900
我想救我妈妈
I'm trying to save my mother.

675
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:17,930
你说是哪个办公室
Now, which office would you say?

676
00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:19,030
是吴
Oh, it's Woo.

677
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,060
肯定是有人看见了我
Someone must have seen me.

678
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:22,340
放松  如果是因为你
Relax. If this is about you,

679
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:24,200
他们早该赶到你家了
they'd be in your house by now.

680
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:27,520
你是15岁小孩吗
What are you, 15?

681
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,820
快点  我们得马上走了
Come on. We gotta go right now.

682
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:32,010
等等  你们或许能制造个临时追踪器
Wait. You might be able to improvise that tracker...

683
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:35,390
只需要修改你调节器的衍射组件
if you modify the diffraction units on one of your regulators.

684
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,740
-这可行  -我都不知道那是什么意思
- That could work. - I don't know what that means.

685
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:40,050
谢谢  谢谢
Thank you. Thank you.

686
00:35:50,290 --> 00:35:51,210
但是  博士
But, Doctor,

687
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:54,570
校警说他们发现了皮姆和凡·戴恩
campus police says they ID'd both Pym and Van Dyne.

688
00:35:54,570 --> 00:35:55,830
我不知道该怎么说  探员
I don't know what to tell you, Agent.

689
00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:58,030
我都30年没跟汉克说过话了
I haven't talked to Hank in 30 years.

690
00:35:58,060 --> 00:35:58,680
我向你保证
I can assure you

691
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:00,360
我是他最不会想见的人了
I'm the last person he would want to visit.

692
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:02,540
得了  你指望我们...
Oh, come on, you expect us to...

693
00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:04,060
为什么
Why is that?

694
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:07,210
简单  我们恨死彼此了
Simple. We hate each other's guts.

695
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,860
我是糟糕的搭档
So I'm a terrible partner?

696
00:36:10,090 --> 00:36:12,290
福斯特  在他平庸的职业生涯中
Foster, he hasn't had one good idea

697
00:36:12,290 --> 00:36:13,460
就没想出过一个好点子
in his unremarkable career.

698
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:15,510
但他关于衍射器的点子可行  是吧
But his idea about the diffractors could work, right?

699
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:17,550
好吧  一个好点子
Fine, one decent idea.

700
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:19,550
但我升级战衣时
Except, I eliminated the diffractors

701
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:21,370
去掉了衍射器
when I upgraded the suits.

702
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:26,270
所以  如果我们有旧战衣
So, if we had an old suit,

703
00:36:26,270 --> 00:36:28,630
我们或许就能追踪到实验室了
we might be able to track down the lab?

704
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:30,130
是的  但我们没有
Yes, but we don't.

705
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,350
-如果我们有呢  -你什么意思
- What if we did? - What do you mean?

706
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:36,250
我是说...
I mean...

707
00:36:37,810 --> 00:36:38,810
人生很奇妙
life's funny.

708
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:41,520
天呐  你没销毁战衣
Oh, my God. You didn't destroy the suit.

709
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:42,150
什么
What?

710
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:44,110
那是你毕生的心血  汉克
Well, it was your life's work, Hank.

711
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:45,990
我不能销毁它
I couldn't destroy that.

712
00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:47,930
我自首之前
Before I turned myself in,

713
00:36:47,930 --> 00:36:49,870
我把它缩小然后邮给了路易斯
I shrunk it down and mailed it to Luis.

714
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:52,330
你把我的战衣邮寄了出去
You sent my suit through the mail?

715
00:36:52,330 --> 00:36:54,810
邮政服务是非常可靠的
Hey, the postal service is very reliable.

716
00:36:54,810 --> 00:36:58,060
现在有追踪码了  像快递服务一样
You know, they do tracking numbers now. Like UPS.

717
00:36:58,070 --> 00:36:59,030
它在哪
Where is it?

718
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:01,730
在一个非常安全的地方  别担心
It's in a very safe place, all right? Don't worry.

719
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:04,510
奖杯吗  不在了
What, the trophy? No, it's not here.

720
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:06,110
什么叫不在了  还能在哪
What do you mean it's not there? Where could it be?

721
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:07,630
我到处看了  不在
I looked everywhere. It's not here.

722
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:09,270
别动那盆花
Hey, get away from the plant.

723
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:11,250
但我跟凯西玩过后  我放回...
But I put it back after Cassie and I...

724
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:13,280
展示说明
Show-and-tell.

725
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:14,730
斯科特
Scotty?

726
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,300
不  别
No, stop!

727
00:37:18,490 --> 00:37:20,710
好消息是  我知道它在哪
Well, the good news is I know where it is.

728
00:37:27,350 --> 00:37:28,390
不是说回到学校时
Whenever you go back to school

729
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:30,540
会觉得一切都变小了吗
isn't everything supposed to look so much smaller?

730
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:32,020
这地方看上去好大
This place seems huge.

731
00:37:32,570 --> 00:37:33,330
怎么了
What is it?

732
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,560
是新调节器
It's the new regulator.

733
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,220
汉克  这件战衣怎么回事
Hank, what's going on with this suit?

734
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:38,310
到底是多"还没完成"
How much of a work in progress is this?

735
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:42,830
不不不
No, no, no.

736
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:56,920
你笑什么  拜托  你能不能
What are you, laughing? Please, could you just...

737
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,090
好啦
Okay, okay.

738
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:03,310
怎么样
What do you see?

739
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,450
尺寸线圈故障了
The sizing coils are malfunctioning.

740
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:06,340
让我...
Just let me...

741
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:11,830
-抱歉  -没事的
- Sorry. - It's all right.

742
00:38:14,170 --> 00:38:15,150
好吧
Okay.

743
00:38:16,010 --> 00:38:16,750
好了
All right.

744
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:18,140
现在试试
Try that.

745
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:23,390
抱歉
Sorry.

746
00:38:24,850 --> 00:38:25,500
什么
What?

747
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:30,670
好啊
Awesome.

748
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:32,650
真希望美队现在能看到你
If only Cap could see you now.

749
00:38:32,830 --> 00:38:34,910
好笑死了  我们怎么办
Hilarious. What are we gonna do?

750
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,530
你有通行证吗
Where's your hall pass?

751
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:51,960
我问你呢
Hey, I'm talking to you.

752
00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:23,730
你可以的
You can do it.

753
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:26,120
马上够到了
You almost got it.

754
00:39:38,350 --> 00:39:39,590
小花生
Oh, peanut.

755
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,220
好了  我们走
Okay, let's go.

756
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:12,360
好啊  小伙儿  今天在学校过得如何
Hiya, champ, how was school today?

757
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,000
好了  有笑话赶紧说完
All right, get your jokes out now.

758
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,400
能不能把战衣修好
Can you fix the suit?

759
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:17,660
脾气真坏
So cranky.

760
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:20,490
要不要来盒果汁和手撕奶酪
You want a juice box and some string cheese?

761
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:22,090
你真有那个吗
Do you really have that?

762
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:34,270
看看福斯特说的对不对
Let's see if Foster was right.

763
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:48,860
这肯定是实验室了
This has gotta be the lab.

764
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:53,680
我们去拿吧
Let's go get it.

765
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:54,810
好
Yeah.

766
00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:05,390
看上去是这里
This seems right.

767
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:10,140
看看我们  一天组队两次
Look at us, teaming up twice in one day.

768
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:11,600
真让人不禁想
Makes you think, huh?

769
00:41:11,990 --> 00:41:12,880
想什么
About what?

770
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,030
德国
Germany.

771
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:15,720
什么意思
What do you mean?

772
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:18,710
我们当时一起工作  一起训练
We were working together, training together...

773
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:21,330
还一起其他的
and other stuffing together.

774
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:23,750
如果我问了你  你会去吗
If I had asked you, would you have come?

775
00:41:23,850 --> 00:41:25,230
看来我们永远不得而知了
I guess we'll never know.

776
00:41:25,810 --> 00:41:26,990
但我知道一件事
But I do know one thing.

777
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:28,200
什么
What?

778
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:30,840
如果我去了  你就不会被抓了
If I had, you'd have never been caught.

779
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:39,870
斯科特
Scott.

780
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,750
你能不能暂时停止对我女儿做白日梦
You think you can stop daydreaming about my daughter

781
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:44,410
去把我的实验室拿回来
long enough to get my lab?

782
00:41:44,410 --> 00:41:46,210
-是  先生  -谢谢
- Yes, sir. - Thank you.

783
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,460
好了  信号收到
Okay, you're transmitting.

784
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,110
怎么这么慢
What took you so long?

785
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,100
抱歉  我给我的蚂蚁想名字来着
Sorry, I had to come up with a name for my ant.

786
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,950
我想叫他尤利西斯·格兰蚁
I'm thinking Ulysses S. Gr-Ant.

787
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,950
{\an3}{\pos(374,247)}尤利西斯·格兰特是第18任美国总统

788
00:42:00,670 --> 00:42:01,420
喜欢吗
You like it?

789
00:42:01,590 --> 00:42:02,480
真好笑
Hilarious.

790
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:05,410
显示屏上什么都看不到
I'm not getting anything on the monitors.

791
00:42:05,410 --> 00:42:07,940
有电子干扰
There's some kind of electronic disturbance.

792
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:08,870
你们小心
Be careful.

793
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,820
你知道我的  汉克  我一向小心
You know me, Hank. I'm always careful...

794
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:13,440
没事  只是那套战衣
It's okay. It's just the suit.

795
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:15,150
-你怎么知道  -看
- How do you know? - Look.

796
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:19,820
那是幽灵吗
That's Ghost?

797
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:21,760
她在干什么
What is she doing?

798
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:24,810
你觉得她是靠战衣穿墙什么的吗
Do you think that suit is how she goes through walls and stuff?

799
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:26,670
我们趁她还没醒赶紧走吧
Let's just get outta here before she wakes up.

800
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:29,410
霍普  看  实验室
Hope, look! There's the lab.

801
00:42:34,570 --> 00:42:36,890
我们确定这是我们的缩小大楼
Now, we're sure this is our shrunken building

802
00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:37,840
不是别人的吧
and not somebody else's, right?

803
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:40,150
快去拿  斯科特  我们得动作快点
Just take it, Scott. Come on, we gotta be fast.

804
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:42,500
我拿
I'll get it.

805
00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:44,980
该死
Oh, shit...

806
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:00,150
霍普  霍普  汉克
Hope. Hope! Hank.

807
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:01,850
伙计们
Guys.

808
00:43:02,370 --> 00:43:04,360
他们应该听不到
I don't think they can hear you.

809
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:10,240
我是艾娃
I'm Ava.

810
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:11,800
斯科特
Scott.

811
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:13,440
看来
So,

812
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,450
你不需要战衣也能
you don't need the suit to...

813
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:19,690
穿墙
go through things.

814
00:43:20,930 --> 00:43:21,700
是啊
No.

815
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:25,800
它只是帮我控制这种状态
It just helps me control it.

816
00:43:27,550 --> 00:43:30,590
本该也能抑制疼痛的
And the pain, supposedly.

817
00:43:35,620 --> 00:43:36,960
你不会把手伸进我的胸膛
You're not gonna reach into my chest

818
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:38,520
捏爆我的心脏吧
and crush my heart, are you?

819
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:43,130
你真好玩
You're funny.

820
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:49,460
我不会伤害你的  斯科特  除非逼不得已
I'm not gonna hurt you, Scott, unless I have to.

821
00:43:52,250 --> 00:43:53,480
我需要
I need...

822
00:43:55,170 --> 00:43:56,360
你脑袋里的东西
what's in your head.

823
00:44:11,150 --> 00:44:12,430
我们把其他人叫醒
Let's wake up the rest of the gang

824
00:44:12,430 --> 00:44:13,960
赶紧开始吧  好吗
and get this over with, shall we?

825
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:17,340
醒醒
Get up!

826
00:44:18,390 --> 00:44:19,280
醒过来
Come on!

827
00:44:22,790 --> 00:44:23,490
爸爸
Dad?

828
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:27,460
你敢再碰他试试
Don't ever touch him again.

829
00:44:27,670 --> 00:44:29,130
好了  霍普
Now, now, Hope...

830
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:31,720
我觉得考虑到一切
I think I'm being rather gentle with your father,

831
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:33,450
我对你父亲算温柔了
all things considered.

832
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:36,160
你说什么呢
What the hell are you talking about?

833
00:44:36,670 --> 00:44:40,060
汉克·皮姆的自大的另一个牺牲品
Another casualty of Hank Pym's ego.

834
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:42,270
比尔
Bill.

835
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:45,170
你做了什么
What have you done?

836
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:48,540
是你做了什么  皮姆博士
It's what you've done, Dr. Pym.

837
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:49,840
你跟她一起的
You're with her?

838
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:52,760
天呐  我以为你挺好呢
Oh, man. I thought you were cool.

839
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:54,660
到底是怎么回事
What the hell is going on here?

840
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:57,350
汉克估计没提过我父亲吧
I doubt Hank has ever mentioned my father.

841
00:44:58,520 --> 00:44:59,520
他怎么会呢
Why would he?

842
00:45:00,170 --> 00:45:02,100
埃利海斯·斯塔尔
Elihas Starr.

843
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:04,900
他们曾是神盾局的同事
They were colleagues at S.H.I.E.L.D.

844
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:06,620
量子研究
Quantum research.

845
00:45:07,630 --> 00:45:11,860
直到我父亲胆敢反对伟大的汉克·皮姆
Until my father dare disagree with the great Hank Pym.

846
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:13,350
你让人开除了他
You had him fired.

847
00:45:13,350 --> 00:45:16,330
还毁掉了他的名誉
Oh, and discredited for good measure.

848
00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:23,100
我父亲想自己继续研究
My father tried to continue his research on his own.

849
00:45:24,450 --> 00:45:27,460
为了恢复名誉  他不惜冒险
Desperate to restore his name, so he took risks.

850
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:28,640
不不
No, no, no!

851
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:30,600
太冒险了
Too many.

852
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:33,190
直到出了岔子
Until something went wrong.

853
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:36,060
他叫我们跑
He told us to run.

854
00:45:36,350 --> 00:45:37,230
埃利海斯  怎么回事
Elihas, what's happening?

855
00:45:37,230 --> 00:45:39,160
快跑吧  跑啊
Just go. Go!

856
00:45:39,190 --> 00:45:40,950
爸爸  爸爸
Daddy! Daddy!

857
00:45:40,950 --> 00:45:42,680
我看得出他很怕
I could tell he was scared.

858
00:45:48,390 --> 00:45:49,110
爸爸
Daddy!

859
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:50,180
艾娃  不要
Ava, no!

860
00:45:53,610 --> 00:45:55,270
我不想留下他一个人
I didn't want him to be alone.

861
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:57,720
不要啊
No! No!

862
00:45:57,720 --> 00:45:59,140
不要
No!

863
00:46:05,690 --> 00:46:08,110
我醒来时  我父母都死了
When I woke up, my parents were dead.

864
00:46:10,850 --> 00:46:12,380
我就没那么幸运了
I wasn't so lucky.

865
00:46:17,710 --> 00:46:20,610
他们称之为"分子失调"
They call it "molecular disequilibrium."

866
00:46:21,590 --> 00:46:23,470
这名字挺蠢的
A rather dull name, I think.

867
00:46:23,620 --> 00:46:26,700
并不能描述它的可怕
Doesn't quite do justice to what it means.

868
00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:30,900
我身体里的每一个细胞都被撕碎
Every cell in my body is torn apart

869
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:32,880
然后又被组了回去
and stitched back together.

870
00:46:33,410 --> 00:46:35,180
一遍又一遍
Over and over.

871
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:36,460
日复一日
Every day.

872
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:40,790
我当时还在神盾局  接到电话说
I was still at S.H.I.E.L.D. when I got the call about a

873
00:46:41,020 --> 00:46:43,320
阿根廷发生了量子异常
quantum anomaly in Argentina.

874
00:46:46,340 --> 00:46:47,500
你好  艾娃
Hello, Ava.

875
00:46:48,570 --> 00:46:49,660
我叫比尔
My name's Bill.

876
00:46:50,770 --> 00:46:52,520
我曾是你父亲的朋友
I was a friend of your father's.

877
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:56,030
我给你带了礼物
I brought you something.

878
00:47:00,410 --> 00:47:02,150
没事  再试一次
It's all right. Try again.

879
00:47:04,150 --> 00:47:04,980
这就对了
That's it.

880
00:47:05,710 --> 00:47:08,170
福斯特博士尽力保护我了
Dr. Foster did his best to keep me safe.

881
00:47:09,310 --> 00:47:10,430
但神盾局的其他人
But others at S.H.I.E.L.D.

882
00:47:10,430 --> 00:47:13,040
把我的病症视为机会
saw an opportunity in my affliction.

883
00:47:16,540 --> 00:47:18,160
他们给我造了件控制衣
They built me a containment suit,

884
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:20,090
让我控制变相
so I could control my phasing.

885
00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:23,160
还训练我成为潜行特工
And trained me to be a stealth operative.

886
00:47:23,710 --> 00:47:25,000
他们把我变成了武器
They weaponized me.

887
00:47:25,930 --> 00:47:28,320
我为他们偷盗  刺探
I stole for them. Spied for them.

888
00:47:28,990 --> 00:47:30,160
杀戮
I killed for them.

889
00:47:31,530 --> 00:47:33,460
我出卖灵魂的代价
And in exchange for my soul

890
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:35,520
是他们会治好我
they were going to cure me.

891
00:47:38,790 --> 00:47:39,780
他们撒了谎
They lied.

892
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:43,920
神盾局陨落后  我收留了艾娃
When S.H.I.E.L.D. collapsed, I took Ava in.

893
00:47:44,450 --> 00:47:46,690
我建造了这个舱来减缓她的衰退
I built the chamber to slow her decay,

894
00:47:46,690 --> 00:47:47,700
但她的病情在加剧
but her condition was progressive.

895
00:47:47,710 --> 00:47:49,350
我不知该如何治好她
I didn't know how to cure it.

896
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:53,280
她想杀你的  汉克  但我阻止了她
She wanted to kill you, Hank, but I told her no

897
00:47:53,290 --> 00:47:54,700
而是叫她观察你
and that she should watch you instead.

898
00:47:54,710 --> 00:47:55,550
不出所料
And sure enough,

899
00:47:55,550 --> 00:47:57,740
她发现你在建隧道
she discovered that you were building the tunnel.

900
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:01,830
然后她又跟我讲了朗
Then, she told me about Lang.

901
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:04,510
以及珍妮特留在他脑袋里的信息
And the message from Janet inside his head,

902
00:48:04,830 --> 00:48:05,650
于是我...
that's when I...

903
00:48:05,830 --> 00:48:06,890
老天爷啊
Christ's sake!

904
00:48:06,890 --> 00:48:08,190
是我的  抱歉
That's me. I'm sorry.

905
00:48:08,190 --> 00:48:10,070
能告诉我是谁在给我发短信吗
Look, can you tell me who's texting me?

906
00:48:11,050 --> 00:48:12,910
凯西  911
"Cassie, 911."

907
00:48:12,910 --> 00:48:14,860
那是我女儿  我得给她回短信
That's my daughter. I need to text her back.

908
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:16,370
不  别想
No, that's not happening.

909
00:48:16,370 --> 00:48:18,510
911就是紧急事件
What, it's 911. That means it's an emergency.

910
00:48:18,510 --> 00:48:20,350
你没资格提要求  朗
You're not making demands here, Lang.

911
00:48:20,350 --> 00:48:22,480
你不懂事态多么严...
You're not appreciating the gravity of the...

912
00:48:23,340 --> 00:48:25,120
好吧  她在给我打视频电话了
Okay, look, she's trying to video chat me now.

913
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:27,960
可能真出事了  让我跟她说话  拜托了
Something might be wrong. Let me talk to her. Please.

914
00:48:30,550 --> 00:48:32,640
凯西  你没事吧  什么急事
Cassie, are you okay? What's the emergency?

915
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:34,580
我找不到我的足球鞋了
I can't find my soccer shoes.

916
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:35,330
什么
What?

917
00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:36,660
我明天还有比赛呢
I have a game tomorrow.

918
00:48:36,670 --> 00:48:38,010
斯科特  我知道鞋就在那边
Hey, Scott, I know that they're there.

919
00:48:38,010 --> 00:48:39,370
你能拿手机在家里走一圈吗
Can you just walk the phone around the house?

920
00:48:39,370 --> 00:48:40,950
我现在不行啊
No, I can't do that right now.

921
00:48:40,950 --> 00:48:42,920
-怎么了  -我病了
- Why not? - Because I'm sick.

922
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:44,760
你能不能稍后找找
Hey, can you just maybe look around later then

923
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:45,670
再打给我
and call me back?

924
00:48:45,670 --> 00:48:46,800
拜托  谢谢
Please? Thank you.

925
00:48:46,860 --> 00:48:48,240
再见  爸爸
Bye, Daddy!

926
00:48:48,270 --> 00:48:49,880
-再见  小花生  -早日康复
- Bye, peanut! - Feel better!

927
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:51,460
早日康复  哥们
Feel better, buddy!

928
00:48:51,670 --> 00:48:53,600
对不起  她说急事的
I'm sorry. It said emergency.

929
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:56,140
艾娃  我想帮你
Ava, I want to help you.

930
00:48:56,140 --> 00:48:58,220
她不需要你的帮助  我知道怎么救她
She doesn't need your help. I know how to save her.

931
00:48:58,230 --> 00:48:59,820
是吗  怎么救
Oh, really? How?

932
00:48:59,850 --> 00:49:00,490
珍妮特
Janet.

933
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:01,600
她这30年来
For the last 30 years,

934
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:03,720
都在量子域吸收量子能
she's been down there absorbing quantum energy.

935
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:05,060
我们可以提取那能量
We can extract that energy.

936
00:49:05,060 --> 00:49:07,540
用它来修复艾娃的分子结构
We can use it to repair Ava's molecular structure...

937
00:49:07,540 --> 00:49:08,210
提取
Extract it?

938
00:49:08,210 --> 00:49:09,960
-是的  -你疯了吗
- Yes. - Are you insane?

939
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:11,310
那会把珍妮特撕裂的
That would rip Janet apart.

940
00:49:11,310 --> 00:49:12,480
这你不能确定
You don't know that.

941
00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:14,550
我要开启隧道
I'm gonna fire up your tunnel.

942
00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:16,590
等珍妮特的位置出现在朗脑子里
When Janet's location pops into Lang's head,

943
00:49:16,590 --> 00:49:17,440
他就得告诉我
he's gonna give it to me

944
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:19,450
否则我就把他交给联调局
or I'm gonna turn him over to the FBI.

945
00:49:19,450 --> 00:49:20,360
什么
What?

946
00:49:20,380 --> 00:49:22,160
你给我留在这里
You are gonna stay here

947
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:24,050
以防我需要你帮忙
just in case I need your help.

948
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:26,670
我才不会帮你
Like hell I would help you!

949
00:49:26,670 --> 00:49:28,020
我怎么说你就得怎么做
You'll do whatever I say.

950
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:28,830
你会害死珍妮特的
You're gonna kill Janet!

951
00:49:28,830 --> 00:49:31,130
你还是多担心自己吧  汉克
I'd be more worried about yourself, Hank.

952
00:49:31,130 --> 00:49:32,540
该死  比尔
Goddamn it, Bill!

953
00:49:33,870 --> 00:49:35,870
-爸爸  -冷静  汉克
- Dad? - Calm down, Hank.

954
00:49:35,870 --> 00:49:37,690
老天啊
So help me God...

955
00:49:38,270 --> 00:49:39,230
药
The pills.

956
00:49:39,230 --> 00:49:40,950
他的心脏  他需要吃药
It's his heart! He needs his pills.

957
00:49:40,950 --> 00:49:42,060
求你  福斯特博士
Please, Dr. Foster.

958
00:49:42,060 --> 00:49:43,690
药就在铁盒里  拜托了
They're in the tin. Please.

959
00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:47,610
他会死的  拜托
He could die! Come on!

960
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:48,770
帮他啊
Help him!

961
00:49:49,290 --> 00:49:50,510
爸爸  撑住了
Dad, just hang on, all right?

962
00:49:50,510 --> 00:49:51,860
继续呼吸  冷静点
Just keep breathing. Stay calm.

963
00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:53,420
帮他啊  快点
Help him, man! Come on!

964
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:54,780
那个薄荷糖盒
The Altoid tin!

965
00:49:57,350 --> 00:49:58,040
等等
Wait!

966
00:50:01,940 --> 00:50:02,950
谢谢了  伙计们
Thanks, guys.

967
00:50:03,910 --> 00:50:04,600
汉克
Hank!

968
00:50:16,790 --> 00:50:19,100
比尔给那姑娘灌输了一脑子的谎言
Bill is filling that girl's head with lies.

969
00:50:19,540 --> 00:50:21,040
埃利海斯·斯塔尔是个叛徒
Elihas Starr was a traitor.

970
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:22,960
他偷了我的图纸
He stole my plans.

971
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:25,310
往下点  锁定
Now, bring it down. All right, lock it in.

972
00:50:25,310 --> 00:50:28,210
不不  螺栓在另一边
No, no, no. The bolt is on the other side.

973
00:50:28,210 --> 00:50:31,170
把那个锁紧  往下拉一点
Tighten that one down, then bring it down one notch.

974
00:50:31,170 --> 00:50:32,250
好样的
Good job.

975
00:50:32,350 --> 00:50:33,340
会成功的
It'll work.

976
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:35,780
福斯特  要是他做  会烧毁系统的
Foster, he could have fried the entire system.

977
00:50:35,780 --> 00:50:36,900
我们调整继电器
Look, we'll adjust the relays

978
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:38,890
你去重编程设置
while you go reprogram the settings, all right?

979
00:50:38,890 --> 00:50:40,010
会成功的
It's going to be fine.

980
00:50:46,270 --> 00:50:47,370
关键时刻到了
So, this is it.

981
00:50:47,590 --> 00:50:49,910
是啊  按说筹备了这么久
Yeah. You'd think with all this time to prepare

982
00:50:49,910 --> 00:50:50,930
我该准备好了
I'd be more ready.

983
00:50:50,930 --> 00:50:53,880
你是没法为进入亚原子状态做好准备的
Oh, going subatomic isn't something you can prepare for.

984
00:50:54,380 --> 00:50:57,090
那会模糊你的意识
It kind of melts your mind.

985
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:58,630
我是指再见到我妈妈
I mean seeing my mom again.

986
00:51:02,030 --> 00:51:04,070
如果她完全变成了另一个人呢
What if she's a completely different person?

987
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:06,750
是啊  比如变成了乔治·华盛顿
Yeah, like, uh, George Washington.

988
00:51:06,770 --> 00:51:08,080
我说真的  斯科特
I'm serious, Scott.

989
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:10,280
或是乔治·杰斐逊
Or George Jefferson.

990
00:51:12,620 --> 00:51:14,340
如果她已经忘记了我呢
What if she's forgotten about me?

991
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:16,910
我在监狱时
When I was in prison...

992
00:51:17,820 --> 00:51:19,900
唯一帮我度过那段时光的就是凯西
the only thing that got me through was Cassie.

993
00:51:20,350 --> 00:51:21,950
我哪怕被关个100年
I could have been locked up for 100 years...

994
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:23,580
也绝不会忘记她
I never would have forgotten her.

995
00:51:25,390 --> 00:51:27,500
我知道你妈妈肯定时刻
I know your mom is counting the minutes

996
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:28,890
都盼着与你团聚
until she can see you again.

997
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:32,160
谢谢
Thank you.

998
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:41,720
我们有大麻烦了
We got a big problem.

999
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:43,230
你忘记大楼后面的
You forgot the motion sensor lights

1000
00:51:43,230 --> 00:51:44,400
运动传感器灯了
on the back of the building.

1001
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:45,790
糟糕
Oh, no.

1002
00:51:45,790 --> 00:51:47,360
提议案里有
And they're on the proposal,

1003
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:49,190
卡拉佩特安还特地问到了
and Karapetyan asked for them specifically.

1004
00:51:49,190 --> 00:51:52,370
是啊  我们忙得挺疯的
Uh, yeah, look, it's been a little crazy.

1005
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:55,420
这样吧  我明天过去  看一眼
Look, maybe I could stop by tomorrow, take a look at it.

1006
00:51:55,430 --> 00:51:56,460
不行
No. No, no, no, no.

1007
00:51:56,460 --> 00:51:57,700
明天一大早就要见面了
The meeting is first thing in the morning.

1008
00:51:57,700 --> 00:51:59,290
你得马上过来解决它
You gotta come right now and fix it.

1009
00:51:59,330 --> 00:52:01,660
我不能  我也想  但我不能走
I can't. I wish I could, but I can't leave.

1010
00:52:01,670 --> 00:52:02,710
这样  我去找你
You know what, I'm coming to you.

1011
00:52:02,710 --> 00:52:05,170
我带图纸过去  就在笔记本电脑上
I'll just bring the plans. They're on the laptop.

1012
00:52:05,170 --> 00:52:06,310
你在那里修改
And you can fix them there.

1013
00:52:06,830 --> 00:52:08,140
告诉我你在哪里
Just tell me where you are, okay?

1014
00:52:08,140 --> 00:52:09,150
一言难尽
It's complicated.

1015
00:52:09,150 --> 00:52:10,610
什么意思  一言难尽
What do you mean it's complicated?

1016
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:16,450
如您所见  先生
As you can see, sir,

1017
00:52:16,450 --> 00:52:18,940
这套系统是最先进的
this system is state of the art.

1018
00:52:18,940 --> 00:52:21,180
明日的安保系统  今日享用
Security of tomorrow, today.

1019
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:22,200
太棒了
Oh, that's so good!

1020
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:24,190
我喜欢你的探身  继续练习
And I love the lean-in, bro. Keep practicin'.

1021
00:52:24,190 --> 00:52:25,300
我得开车去斯科特那里
Hey, I just gotta drive up to Scotty's,

1022
00:52:25,300 --> 00:52:26,510
我们好修改图纸
so we can fix the plans.

1023
00:52:26,510 --> 00:52:28,100
别担心  我回来时肯定还有时间
But don't worry, I'll be back in plenty of time.

1024
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:29,810
如您所见
As you can see...

1025
00:52:31,270 --> 00:52:32,830
你们为明早把货车洗干净了吧
Tell me you got the van washed for tomorrow morning.

1026
00:52:32,830 --> 00:52:34,350
底盘都洗了
Down to the undercarriage, baby.

1027
00:52:34,350 --> 00:52:36,140
你还要了洗底盘
You sprung for the undercarriage wash?

1028
00:52:36,140 --> 00:52:37,400
你叫我全洗的
Well, you said get the works.

1029
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:38,040
那是骗人的  哥们
That's a scam, bro.

1030
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:39,740
我们住在加州  又不是明尼苏达州
We live in California, not Minnesota.

1031
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:40,750
他说得对
He's right.

1032
00:52:41,780 --> 00:52:43,310
洗底盘
The undercarriage wash,

1033
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:45,600
是为了洗掉除冰盐
that's for cleaning off road salt

1034
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:48,310
我们更爱下雪的姐妹州的道路上才会撒那个
laid down in our more snow-laden sister states.

1035
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:51,070
你是谁  你怎么会这么清楚洗车行业的规矩
Who are you, and why do you know so much about car wash protocol?

1036
00:52:51,730 --> 00:52:53,670
我叫桑尼·伯奇
Well, my name is Sonny Burch.

1037
00:52:54,030 --> 00:52:56,580
我很会做调查  路易斯
And I do my research, Luis.

1038
00:52:57,790 --> 00:53:02,390
我还从一个联调局的朋友那里得知
To wit, I have learned from a friend of mine at the FBI

1039
00:53:02,390 --> 00:53:04,820
你跟斯科特·朗相熟
that you are a known associate of Scott Lang...

1040
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:08,130
斯科特和汉克·皮姆相熟  我还知道
a known associate of Hank Pym, who I've also learned

1041
00:53:08,270 --> 00:53:10,300
汉克有个便携可缩小实验室
has a portable shrinking laboratory

1042
00:53:10,570 --> 00:53:12,680
里面有各式各样有趣的科技
filled with all kinds of juicy tech.

1043
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:15,390
你得告诉我  它在哪
And you're gonna tell me where it is.

1044
00:53:16,140 --> 00:53:17,860
我真不想告诉你
Well, I hate to break it to you, but

1045
00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:19,150
但我不知道你在说什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

1046
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:22,880
你好像有点抵触  路易斯
Well, I sense a resistance in you, Luis.

1047
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:26,230
但我答应了某些危险人物给他们问出结果
And I have promised results to some dangerous people.

1048
00:53:26,230 --> 00:53:30,350
所以  给你介绍一下我的好友  乌兹曼
So, I'm gonna introduce you to my good friend, Uzman.

1049
00:53:30,890 --> 00:53:34,100
乌兹曼特别擅长
Now... Uzman is a master

1050
00:53:34,270 --> 00:53:35,610
通过精神手段
at extracting information

1051
00:53:35,610 --> 00:53:38,700
撬开不愿开口的人的嘴
from the unwilling through psychoactive means.

1052
00:53:40,110 --> 00:53:41,740
那是吐真剂吗
Oh, is that truth serum?

1053
00:53:42,100 --> 00:53:44,190
不存在吐真剂这种东西
There's no such thing as truth serum.

1054
00:53:44,190 --> 00:53:46,150
那就是电视节目的鬼扯
That's just nonsense from TV.

1055
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:47,440
那它是什么
Well, what is it then?

1056
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:49,040
这是一种混合药剂
It's a little concoction

1057
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:52,100
从他当年还在MI6时  就一直在改良
that he's been perfecting since his days with the S.I.S.

1058
00:53:52,210 --> 00:53:55,120
它会让你极容易受到暗示  有问必答
It makes you suggestible and highly responsive.

1059
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:56,300
哥们  那就是吐真剂
Well, dude, that's truth serum.

1060
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:57,280
不是的
No, it's not.

1061
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:00,370
无意冒犯  但是我觉得那就是吐真剂
No offensing, but they sound like truth serum to me.

1062
00:54:00,370 --> 00:54:02,520
-是吧  -它不是吐真剂
- Right? - It's not a truth serum.

1063
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:04,040
好吧  我相信你
Okay. Hey, I believe you.

1064
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:05,690
不是吐真剂
It's not a truth serum.

1065
00:54:05,690 --> 00:54:09,080
如果它看起来像吐真剂  功能也是吐真
I mean, if it walk like duck and talk like ducks...

1066
00:54:09,170 --> 00:54:10,130
那它就是吐真剂
The truth serum.

1067
00:54:10,130 --> 00:54:11,640
我过敏的东西可多了
Well, I have a lot of allergies...

1068
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:13,860
请你三思
so you might wanna think about that.

1069
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:18,590
我们得夺回实验室
We've got to get that lab back.

1070
00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:20,660
怎么了
What?

1071
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:24,370
舱和战衣几乎无法帮你控制病情了
The chamber and the suit are barely helping anymore.

1072
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:27,110
我还能活多久
How long have I got?

1073
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:32,410
几周吧
A couple of weeks, maybe.

1074
00:54:34,810 --> 00:54:36,700
那我们逼他们把实验室拿回来
Well, then we'll make them bring the lab back.

1075
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:37,850
怎么做
How?

1076
00:54:39,310 --> 00:54:41,590
朗  他有个女儿  对吧
Lang. He has a daughter, right?

1077
00:54:41,590 --> 00:54:42,820
你不是真想这么干吧
You can't mean that.

1078
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:43,880
艾娃
Ava!

1079
00:54:46,230 --> 00:54:48,300
你在外面惹的祸  我都忍了
I tolerate a lot of the things you do out there...

1080
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:50,230
但这种事我绝不参与
but I won't be a part of anything like that.

1081
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:53,820
在渐渐消失的不是你  比尔
You're not the one who's about to fade away into nothing, Bill.

1082
00:54:53,830 --> 00:54:54,850
而是我
I am!

1083
00:54:55,350 --> 00:54:57,130
你说你能治好我
You said you could fix me!

1084
00:54:59,990 --> 00:55:01,520
你保证过的
You promised.

1085
00:55:01,890 --> 00:55:03,590
我知道  我会的
I know. I will.

1086
00:55:04,130 --> 00:55:05,370
但不能那样做
But not like that.

1087
00:55:07,710 --> 00:55:09,620
你敢碰那小女孩一下
You lay one finger on that little girl...

1088
00:55:10,550 --> 00:55:12,610
我就不帮你了  我们分道扬镳
I won't help you. And we're done.

1089
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:19,280
好吧
Fine.

1090
00:55:21,070 --> 00:55:22,530
还有其他选择
There are other options.

1091
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:39,190
你知道吗  你说得对  这不是吐真剂
You know what? You're right. This isn't truth serum.

1092
00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:40,400
因为我一点感觉都没有
Because I don't feel anything.

1093
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:42,150
我撒谎了  我有感觉
That was a lie. I do feel something.

1094
00:55:42,620 --> 00:55:43,500
这就是吐真剂
This is truth serum!

1095
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:44,680
吐真剂是不存在的
There's no such thing!

1096
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:45,620
好了
Okay.

1097
00:55:46,530 --> 00:55:47,830
好了  好了
Okay, okay.

1098
00:55:48,710 --> 00:55:51,290
很简单  路易斯
Now, I'm gonna make this real easy for you, Luis.

1099
00:55:51,290 --> 00:55:52,230
好
Okay.

1100
00:55:54,710 --> 00:55:57,730
斯科特·朗在哪
Where is Scott Lang?

1101
00:55:58,200 --> 00:55:59,470
这事说来话长
Well, see, that's complicated.

1102
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:01,510
我第一次遇见斯科特时  他糟透了
Because when I first met Scotty, he was in a bad place.

1103
00:56:01,510 --> 00:56:03,050
而且我不是指牢房D区
And I'm not talkin' about cell block D.

1104
00:56:03,050 --> 00:56:04,900
他妻子刚刚申请离婚  我说
His wife had just filed for divorce, and I was, like...

1105
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:06,780
"该死  哥们  她在你蹲号子时甩了你"
"Damn, homie. She dumped you when you're on lockup?"

1106
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:07,460
他说"是啊  我知道
And he was, like, "Yeah, I know.

1107
00:56:07,460 --> 00:56:08,970
我以为我能跟她白头偕老呢
"I thought I was gonna be with her forever...

1108
00:56:08,970 --> 00:56:09,860
结果现在我孤身一人"
"But now I'm all alone."

1109
00:56:09,860 --> 00:56:10,940
我说"哥们  你知道吗
And I was, like, "Damn, homie. You know what?

1110
00:56:10,940 --> 00:56:12,640
振作点  你有新搭档了
"You gotta chin up, because you'll find a new partner.

1111
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:13,990
你知道吗  我是路易斯"
"But you know what? I'm Luis."

1112
00:56:13,990 --> 00:56:15,360
他说"你知道吗  我是斯科特
And he says, "You know what? I'm Scotty,

1113
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:16,070
我们会成为铁哥们的"
"And we're gonna be best friends."

1114
00:56:16,070 --> 00:56:17,380
打住  打住
Okay, hold on, hold on.

1115
00:56:17,390 --> 00:56:19,200
我很喜欢听精彩的故事
I like a good story as much as the next person...

1116
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:20,220
但是  这些跟斯科特·朗在哪
but what in the hell does this have to do

1117
00:56:20,220 --> 00:56:21,200
有什么关系
with where Scott Lang is?

1118
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:22,580
我快讲到了  就快讲到了
I'm getting there. I'm getting there.

1119
00:56:22,580 --> 00:56:25,520
你投了币  就得听完整首歌
You put a dime in him, you gotta let the whole song play out.

1120
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:27,370
他就像人形点唱机
He like human jukebox.

1121
00:56:27,370 --> 00:56:29,280
我奶奶开的餐厅里有台点唱机
Oh, my abuelita had a jukebox in the restaurant!

1122
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:30,930
是啊  只放莫里西的歌
Yeah, only played Morrissey.

1123
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:33,690
要是有人抱怨  她就...
And if anybody ever complained, she'd be like...

1124
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:35,850
墨西哥裔  我们喊他们墨兹
You know, Chicanos, we call him "Moz."

1125
00:56:35,850 --> 00:56:36,900
然后她就说"不送"
Then, ¡adios!

1126
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:39,820
没办法  他忧郁的情歌让我们很有共鸣
What can I say? We relate to his melancholy ballads, you know?

1127
00:56:39,860 --> 00:56:41,450
-朗  -好好好
- Lang! - Right, right, right.

1128
00:56:41,460 --> 00:56:42,810
后来  斯科特出狱了
So, anyway, Scotty gets out of jail,

1129
00:56:42,810 --> 00:56:43,500
他开始为汉克工作
and he starts working for Hank.

1130
00:56:43,510 --> 00:56:45,280
这时他遇到了霍普  霍普却一副
That's when he met Hope. And Hope's all, like...

1131
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:46,220
"我不想跟你扯上关系
"I want nothing to do with you.

1132
00:56:46,220 --> 00:56:47,820
看看我的发型  我超正经"的样子
"Look at my hairdo, I'm all business."

1133
00:56:47,830 --> 00:56:48,840
斯科特就说
And then Scotty's, like,

1134
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:50,410
知道吗  妹子  我的心已碎
"You know what, girl? My heart is all broken.

1135
00:56:50,410 --> 00:56:51,590
我可能再也不会爱了
"And I'll probably never find love again,

1136
00:56:51,590 --> 00:56:52,810
但我可真想吻你
"But damn if I want to kiss you!"

1137
00:56:52,810 --> 00:56:53,550
时间快进
But then you fast forward

1138
00:56:53,550 --> 00:56:55,020
他们就爱上彼此了
and they're all into each other, right?

1139
00:56:55,020 --> 00:56:55,880
然后斯科特说
And then Scotty's, like,

1140
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:57,320
知道吗  我不能告诉你
"You know what? I can't tell you this...

1141
00:56:57,320 --> 00:56:59,280
但我要去跟美国队长砸烂一座机场
"But I'm gonna go trash an airport with Captain America."

1142
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:01,250
然后她说  真不敢相信你就那么跑了
And then she said, "I can't believe you split like that!

1143
00:57:01,250 --> 00:57:02,590
回见了  蠢蛋
"Smell you later, dummy."

1144
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:04,010
于是斯科特就被软禁了
So, Scotty goes on house arrest.

1145
00:57:04,010 --> 00:57:05,800
他不肯承认  但他心里觉得
And he won't admit it, but his heart is all, like...

1146
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:07,060
该死  我还以为霍普可以成为
"Damn! I thought Hope coulda been

1147
00:57:07,060 --> 00:57:09,040
我的新真搭档呢  但我搞砸了
"My new true partner, but I blew it!"

1148
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:10,240
但命运让他们又走到了一起
But fate brought 'em back together.

1149
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:11,390
然后霍普心里就想
And then Hope's heart is all...

1150
00:57:11,390 --> 00:57:13,060
我担心我不能信任他
"I'm worried that I can't trust him...

1151
00:57:13,060 --> 00:57:14,680
他会再次搞砸  毁掉一切
"And he's gonna screw up again, and ruin everything!"

1152
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:16,200
然后我心里就想
And then my heart is all, like...

1153
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:18,330
那高档覆盆子点心代表了公司的负债
"That fancy raspberry filling represents the company's red

1154
00:57:18,330 --> 00:57:20,060
我们只差几天就要倒闭了
"And we're days away from going out of business. "

1155
00:57:20,070 --> 00:57:20,990
倒闭
"Out of business"?

1156
00:57:20,990 --> 00:57:21,920
只差几天
"Days away"?

1157
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:22,990
该死的吐真剂
Damn truth serum!

1158
00:57:22,990 --> 00:57:25,400
我其实是想保护你们的  我发誓
I was trying to protect you guys. I swear to God.

1159
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:27,430
我是想做个好老板的  但我们破产了
I was trying to be a good boss, but we're broke!

1160
00:57:27,430 --> 00:57:28,370
卡拉佩特安是我们最后的希望
And the Karapetyan's our last hope.

1161
00:57:28,370 --> 00:57:29,580
如果我们不去  我们就完了
And if we don't show up, we're done!

1162
00:57:29,580 --> 00:57:30,840
这叫什么好老板
That's terrible bossing!

1163
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:31,460
该死  哥们
Damn, bro!

1164
00:57:31,460 --> 00:57:32,890
这怪我  这怪我
That's on me! That's on me!

1165
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:34,840
够了
Enough.

1166
00:57:38,110 --> 00:57:39,690
我要再问你一次
I'm gonna ask you one more time.

1167
00:57:41,290 --> 00:57:42,350
斯科特·朗在哪
Where is Scott Lang?

1168
00:57:42,350 --> 00:57:43,250
我这不说呢吗
I've been trying to tell you,

1169
00:57:43,250 --> 00:57:44,570
他现在处境尴尬  从情感上说
he's in a tricky spot, emotionally speaking.

1170
00:57:44,570 --> 00:57:45,830
从情感上说
Emotionally speaking.

1171
00:57:46,190 --> 00:57:49,580
那斯科特·朗  人在哪里
Well, where is Scott Lang, literally speaking!

1172
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:50,960
森林里
The woods.

1173
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:51,740
森林里
The woods?

1174
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:54,140
雅加婆婆
Baba Yaga!

1175
00:57:54,740 --> 00:57:56,390
什么意思  "森林里"
What do you mean, "The woods"?

1176
00:57:56,390 --> 00:57:57,170
缪尔森林
The Muir Woods,

1177
00:57:57,170 --> 00:57:59,020
全景高速的第二条消防道路上
the second fire road off the Panoramic Highway!

1178
00:57:59,020 --> 00:58:00,300
老天爷啊
For God's sake!

1179
00:58:01,970 --> 00:58:04,150
雅加婆婆  晚上到来
Baba Yaga, come at night

1180
00:58:04,150 --> 00:58:06,430
小娃娃们  好好睡
Little children, sleepy tight

1181
00:58:09,790 --> 00:58:10,600
该死的
Damn it!

1182
00:58:12,100 --> 00:58:13,320
如果那怪物拿到皮姆的设备
If that freak gets Pym's tech...

1183
00:58:13,330 --> 00:58:14,630
我就再别想找回来了
I'm never gonna see it.

1184
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:16,590
我们怎么办
So, what do we do now?

1185
00:58:17,650 --> 00:58:19,140
从联调局那里偷
It's easier to steal it from the Feds

1186
00:58:19,140 --> 00:58:20,470
比从妖怪那里偷要简单
than from the boogeyman.

1187
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:25,740
是我  你想升个职吗
Hey, it's me. How'd you like to get a promotion?

1188
00:58:26,430 --> 00:58:29,680
我知道皮姆  凡·戴恩和朗在哪
I got the location on Pym, Van Dyne and Lang.

1189
00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:31,360
但你得马上去抓到他们
But you gonna have to take 'em down now,

1190
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:32,880
因为他们不会在那里待很久的
because they ain't gonna be there for long.

1191
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:35,450
等你抓到他们  你要把实验室给我
And when you do, you gonna get me that lab.

1192
00:58:36,270 --> 00:58:37,160
知道了
Understood.

1193
00:58:39,140 --> 00:58:40,300
好消息  先生们
Good news, gentlemen.

1194
00:58:40,860 --> 00:58:42,680
联调局会替我们完成累活儿
Feds are gonna do the hard work for us.

1195
00:58:43,790 --> 00:58:45,580
看什么呢  给我换胎
What are you lookin' at? Change my tires!

1196
00:58:45,590 --> 00:58:46,210
好
Right.

1197
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:50,970
-先生  -不知道敲门吗
- Sir. - Can you knock?

1198
00:58:51,860 --> 00:58:54,400
抱歉  先生  我收到条线索
Sorry, sir. Uh, but I just got a lead.

1199
00:58:55,850 --> 00:58:56,850
我喜欢线索
I love leads.

1200
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:05,400
系统已就绪
System's in the green.

1201
00:59:05,550 --> 00:59:07,030
线圈充电
Priming the coils.

1202
00:59:09,650 --> 00:59:10,680
满电
Full charge.

1203
00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:11,690
等隧道打开
As soon as the tunnel's open

1204
00:59:11,690 --> 00:59:12,680
一旦你收到任何疑似是
let us know if you get anything

1205
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:14,070
她的信息  都告诉我们
that could be a part of her message.

1206
00:59:14,070 --> 00:59:15,290
好的  没问题
Yeah, yeah. I will.

1207
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:18,480
那好
Okay, then.

1208
00:59:21,860 --> 00:59:22,890
开始了
Here it goes.

1209
00:59:36,830 --> 00:59:37,680
我们成功了
We did it!

1210
00:59:38,980 --> 00:59:40,030
有反应吗
You got anything?

1211
00:59:43,630 --> 00:59:44,290
没有
Nothin'.

1212
00:59:45,170 --> 00:59:47,100
等一等  因为可能...
Well, just give it a minute, because it could...

1213
00:59:48,820 --> 00:59:49,470
不
No.

1214
00:59:50,170 --> 00:59:51,860
不不不
No, no, no, no!

1215
00:59:52,020 --> 00:59:52,520
怎么回事
What's happening?

1216
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:54,580
要停机了  可能是我们的向量不对
It's shutting down. Maybe our vectors are off.

1217
00:59:54,580 --> 00:59:57,110
我们都算过一百万次了  肯定是对的
We've gone over them a million times, I know they're right!

1218
00:59:57,110 --> 00:59:58,240
那还能是因为什么
Then what else could it be?

1219
00:59:58,240 --> 00:59:59,250
我不知道
I don't know!

1220
01:00:06,050 --> 01:00:07,630
-斯科特  你干吗  -斯科特  别乱动
- Scott, what are you doing? - Scott, get away from that!

1221
01:00:07,630 --> 01:00:08,540
斯科特  你别...
Scott, you can't...

1222
01:00:08,550 --> 01:00:10,380
对不起  我不知道我还有多久
I'm sorry, I don't know how much time I have.

1223
01:00:10,390 --> 01:00:12,080
我得改好算法
I need to fix the algorithm.

1224
01:00:13,990 --> 01:00:16,010
相信我  在下面待了30年
Trust me, after 30 years down here...

1225
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:17,940
我都想得很清楚了
I've thought about it a lot.

1226
01:00:22,710 --> 01:00:23,610
珍妮特
Janet?

1227
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:27,620
亲爱的
Hi, honey.

1228
01:00:31,580 --> 01:00:32,590
小糖豆
Jellybean.

1229
01:00:33,540 --> 01:00:34,300
妈妈
Mom?

1230
01:00:35,580 --> 01:00:37,260
这并不是我所想象的团聚
It's not the reunion I'd imagined.

1231
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:38,860
太赶了
It's all so rushed.

1232
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:41,450
你俩做得太棒了
You two have done such great work.

1233
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:43,460
你们只需要一点点的
You just need a little...

1234
01:00:44,460 --> 01:00:45,180
帮助
nudge.

1235
01:00:59,950 --> 01:01:02,400
珍妮特  这怎么可能
Janet, how is this possible?

1236
01:01:05,020 --> 01:01:06,550
你放在斯科特脑子里的不是一则信息
It wasn't a message you put in Scott's head.

1237
01:01:06,550 --> 01:01:07,910
而是个天线
It was an antenna.

1238
01:01:07,910 --> 01:01:09,150
真聪明
Clever girl.

1239
01:01:09,810 --> 01:01:11,210
我好为你骄傲
I'm so proud of you.

1240
01:01:11,930 --> 01:01:13,860
亲爱的  告诉我们你在哪
Honey, tell us where you are.

1241
01:01:13,860 --> 01:01:15,480
告诉我们怎么找到你
Tell us how to find you.

1242
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:17,550
不  概率场太复杂了
No, the probability fields are too complex.

1243
01:01:17,550 --> 01:01:19,240
所以我才需要跟你对话
That's why I needed to talk to you.

1244
01:01:19,260 --> 01:01:20,660
你得追随我的声音
You have to follow my voice.

1245
01:01:21,220 --> 01:01:21,850
当然了
Of course!

1246
01:01:21,850 --> 01:01:24,000
就像追踪一通电话
Like tracing a call back to its source!

1247
01:01:28,360 --> 01:01:31,940
我在用亚原子频率追踪你的信号
I'm tracking your signal using subatomic frequencies

1248
01:01:32,080 --> 01:01:34,720
范围是1点和9点
between point two and point nine.

1249
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:36,340
最好缩小到4和6
I'd narrow it to four and six.

1250
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:37,690
太窄了  可能会错过你
That's too tight. We could miss you.

1251
01:01:37,690 --> 01:01:39,420
看看我们  又在吵了
Look at us squabbling again.

1252
01:01:40,410 --> 01:01:42,960
好吧  那就3和7
Fine. All right, between three and seven.

1253
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:46,340
我们数十年来第一次吵架  就这么结束了
Our first fight in decades, and it's over just like that.

1254
01:02:01,940 --> 01:02:02,760
正中红心
Bullseye.

1255
01:02:03,340 --> 01:02:04,310
信号源锁定
Source lock.

1256
01:02:04,630 --> 01:02:05,630
是你
It's you.

1257
01:02:07,060 --> 01:02:08,000
我们找到了
We got it!

1258
01:02:08,840 --> 01:02:11,140
你们得去这个坐标找我
You have to meet me at these exact coordinates.

1259
01:02:11,140 --> 01:02:13,670
在荒原里  越过量子真空
In the wasteland, beyond the quantum void.

1260
01:02:13,780 --> 01:02:14,620
那里很危险
It's very dangerous,

1261
01:02:14,620 --> 01:02:17,250
尤其是对人类大脑  务必小心
especially on the human mind, so be careful.

1262
01:02:17,290 --> 01:02:19,890
时间和时空的规则在这里很不一样
Time and space work very differently down here.

1263
01:02:19,890 --> 01:02:21,240
你们只有两小时
You have two hours.

1264
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:23,230
之后  概率场会变动
After that, the probability fields will shift...

1265
01:02:23,230 --> 01:02:24,050
要再过一世纪
and it'll be another century

1266
01:02:24,050 --> 01:02:25,850
才能再次这样对齐了
before they align like this again.

1267
01:02:25,970 --> 01:02:27,040
我们会找到你的
We'll find you.

1268
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:36,160
我知道你会的  小糖豆
I know you will, Jellybean.

1269
01:02:41,340 --> 01:02:42,030
不
Nope.

1270
01:02:42,950 --> 01:02:43,930
没感觉  我完全没感觉
Nothing. I got nothing.

1271
01:02:43,930 --> 01:02:45,120
完全感觉不到珍妮特
No sign of Janet.

1272
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:46,340
这可好
Perfect.

1273
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:48,950
我们怎么上来的
How did we get up here?

1274
01:02:54,460 --> 01:02:56,000
好  首先你会看到好多光
All right, first you're gonna see all kinds of lights...

1275
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,400
然后会变得很颠簸
and it's gonna get really trippy...

1276
01:02:57,400 --> 01:03:00,470
然后会一片漆黑寂静  非常寂静
but then it's gonna turn black and silent. Really silent.

1277
01:03:00,470 --> 01:03:01,960
斯科特  我没事的
Scott, I'll be fine.

1278
01:03:02,100 --> 01:03:03,230
我就是说说  因为我去过嘛
I'm just saying because I've been down there.

1279
01:03:03,230 --> 01:03:04,630
嗯  你说过了
Yeah, so you've mentioned.

1280
01:03:08,110 --> 01:03:10,160
抱歉  我得接一下
Um, sorry. I have to take this.

1281
01:03:11,540 --> 01:03:12,740
哥们  你来不来啊
Hey, man, you coming?

1282
01:03:12,740 --> 01:03:14,660
我不去了  但知道吗  幽灵要去
No, I'm not, but you know what? Ghost is.

1283
01:03:14,660 --> 01:03:16,810
知道吗  联调局  他们也知道你们在哪
And you know what? The Feds, they know where you are.

1284
01:03:16,900 --> 01:03:18,480
-什么  -对不起
- What? - I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1285
01:03:18,520 --> 01:03:19,780
他们给我用了吐真剂
They gave me some truth serum.

1286
01:03:19,780 --> 01:03:21,600
然后我突然就开始老实交待
And then all of a sudden I started talkin' all honestly.

1287
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:23,560
比如  我讨厌你用洗碗机的方式
Like, I hate the way that you load the dishwasher.

1288
01:03:23,730 --> 01:03:24,930
我非常讨厌
I hate it, I hate it.

1289
01:03:25,120 --> 01:03:25,810
但你得回家了
But you need to go home

1290
01:03:25,810 --> 01:03:27,470
因为联调局可能正在赶过去
because the Feds are probably going there now!

1291
01:03:27,970 --> 01:03:28,720
对了
And by the way...

1292
01:03:28,730 --> 01:03:31,810
谁会把盘子放在最上层啊  就不该放那里
who puts the plates on the top rack? They don't go there!

1293
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:42,090
我觉得自己好混蛋
I feel like such a jerk.

1294
01:03:42,090 --> 01:03:44,980
你们会气死的  我们得马上走了
You're gonna be really mad. We gotta go now.

1295
01:03:45,470 --> 01:03:46,120
什么
What?

1296
01:03:46,120 --> 01:03:48,490
幽灵和联调局都知道我们在哪了
Ghost knows where we are. So does the FBI.

1297
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:49,240
怎么会
How?

1298
01:03:49,240 --> 01:03:51,360
-我告诉路易斯了  -什么
- I told Luis where we are. - You what?

1299
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:52,110
我叫他过来
I told him to come here

1300
01:03:52,110 --> 01:03:53,900
我好帮忙修改卡拉佩特安的提议案
so I could help him with the Karapetyan proposal.

1301
01:03:53,900 --> 01:03:54,950
天呐
Oh, my God!

1302
01:03:55,810 --> 01:03:57,330
听着  我们必须拿到那个客户
Look, we need to land that account.

1303
01:03:57,330 --> 01:03:58,620
否则我们会失业的
Otherwise, we lose the business!

1304
01:03:58,620 --> 01:04:00,910
你们知道前科犯现在找工作多难吗
Do you know hard it is for ex-cons to find work these days?

1305
01:04:00,910 --> 01:04:02,240
天呐  斯科特
Jesus, Scott!

1306
01:04:11,670 --> 01:04:13,270
关闭孔洞需要90秒
90 seconds to close the aperture!

1307
01:04:13,270 --> 01:04:15,160
我们得先给线圈消磁
You have to depolarize the coils first!

1308
01:04:15,160 --> 01:04:15,880
我知道
I know!

1309
01:04:15,880 --> 01:04:17,690
我很抱歉  但是
I'm really sorry, but the, um...

1310
01:04:18,330 --> 01:04:20,720
联调局要去我家了
FBI is coming to my place so...

1311
01:04:21,260 --> 01:04:22,180
我得走了
I have to go.

1312
01:04:24,710 --> 01:04:25,690
我能借用下战衣吗
Can I borrow the suit?

1313
01:04:26,940 --> 01:04:29,330
回转仪稳定器
Gyroscopic stabilizers.

1314
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:30,730
启动
Powering on.

1315
01:04:30,730 --> 01:04:32,470
我要把战衣借走了
I'm just gonna borrow the suit.

1316
01:04:33,290 --> 01:04:35,290
我会回来的  告诉我你们会去哪
I'll come back. Just tell me where you'll be.

1317
01:04:35,290 --> 01:04:36,890
-不必了  -什么
- Don't bother. - What?

1318
01:04:36,890 --> 01:04:38,180
我们找到我妈妈后
We'll come and get the suit from you,

1319
01:04:38,180 --> 01:04:39,590
会去找你取回战衣的
as soon as we've found my mom.

1320
01:04:39,590 --> 01:04:41,470
-霍普  -斯科特  走吧
- Hope... - Scott, just go!

1321
01:04:59,290 --> 01:05:01,210
-斯科特  -爸爸
- Scott? - Daddy?

1322
01:05:01,210 --> 01:05:02,270
是我们  哥们
It's us, buddy!

1323
01:05:02,370 --> 01:05:04,760
我们来拿凯西的鞋
We're here for Cassie's shoes!

1324
01:05:05,030 --> 01:05:06,250
他肯定在休养
He must be resting.

1325
01:05:06,250 --> 01:05:08,600
亲爱的  你上楼去你床底下找找吧
Honey, why don't you go upstairs and look under your bed?

1326
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:10,770
爸爸  你在楼上吗
Daddy, you upstairs?

1327
01:05:12,030 --> 01:05:12,980
爸爸
Daddy?

1328
01:05:14,430 --> 01:05:15,310
怎么...
What the...

1329
01:05:17,090 --> 01:05:19,590
他现在真是脏得像猪
He really lives like a pig these days.

1330
01:05:22,660 --> 01:05:23,550
爸爸
Daddy?

1331
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:32,360
散开
Spread it out!

1332
01:05:33,700 --> 01:05:34,400
又来
Again?

1333
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:36,280
你们真不知耻
You people have no shame!

1334
01:05:36,280 --> 01:05:37,900
监控器显示他在浴室
The monitor says that he's in the bathroom.

1335
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:39,180
我才不信
Yeah, I'm not buying it!

1336
01:05:41,780 --> 01:05:43,810
凯西  让他过去
Cassie, let the man get by!

1337
01:05:43,820 --> 01:05:45,320
但爸爸病得好厉害
But Daddy's super sick!

1338
01:05:45,320 --> 01:05:46,350
我去瞧瞧看
I'll see about that!

1339
01:05:46,350 --> 01:05:48,450
他说他不希望传染别人
He says he doesn't want anyone else to get sick!

1340
01:05:48,450 --> 01:05:50,310
我乐意冒个险  亲爱的
Well, I'll take my chances, sweetie.

1341
01:05:50,540 --> 01:05:52,830
他吐了  好多呢
He barfed. Like, a lot.

1342
01:05:52,830 --> 01:05:54,250
小姑娘  我是联邦探员
Young lady, I'm a federal agent.

1343
01:05:54,250 --> 01:05:56,190
我见过比呕吐物更糟的东西
I've seen worse things than vomit.

1344
01:05:57,500 --> 01:05:58,300
好多好多吗
Like, "a lot" a lot?

1345
01:05:58,300 --> 01:06:00,490
-是啊  -不管了  让开
- Yes! - Forget it, move aside!

1346
01:06:00,490 --> 01:06:01,380
不要
No!

1347
01:06:08,310 --> 01:06:10,730
-你怎么来了  -斯科特
- What are you doing here? - Scott.

1348
01:06:11,630 --> 01:06:14,530
抱歉  我病得很重
I'm sorry, I'm just really sick.

1349
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:16,250
我说了吧
I told you.

1350
01:06:16,950 --> 01:06:17,470
抱歉
Excuse me.

1351
01:06:17,470 --> 01:06:19,790
有时就是得吐出来才爽  是吧
Sometimes you gotta just get it out. You know?

1352
01:06:20,260 --> 01:06:20,930
抱歉
Sorry.

1353
01:06:28,430 --> 01:06:29,700
我去启动车
I'll start the van.

1354
01:06:30,300 --> 01:06:31,490
你拿实验室
You get the lab.

1355
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:37,070
别动  你们被包围了
Freeze! You're surrounded!

1356
01:06:50,760 --> 01:06:51,710
汉克·皮姆
Hank Pym...

1357
01:06:52,370 --> 01:06:53,480
霍普·凡·戴恩
Hope Van Dyne...

1358
01:06:53,770 --> 01:06:55,000
你们被捕了
you're under arrest.

1359
01:06:56,920 --> 01:06:58,070
这是骚扰
This is harassment!

1360
01:06:58,070 --> 01:06:59,270
其实  不是的
Actually, it's not.

1361
01:06:59,340 --> 01:07:00,980
联调局什么意思啊
What does the FBI even stand for...

1362
01:07:00,990 --> 01:07:03,410
永远骚扰个人吗
"Forever Bothering Individuals"?

1363
01:07:04,710 --> 01:07:07,060
-他的监控器没问题吗  -当然了
- His monitor check out? - Of course it does.

1364
01:07:07,720 --> 01:07:08,500
该死
Damn it!

1365
01:07:09,170 --> 01:07:11,180
看来我被骗了
Looks like I just got fed a bowl of malarkey.

1366
01:07:11,700 --> 01:07:12,560
我们抓到他们了  先生
We got 'em, sir.

1367
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:14,180
皮姆和凡·戴恩都已被羁押
Pym and Van Dyne are in custody.

1368
01:07:14,180 --> 01:07:16,470
真的吗  太好了
Seriously? Yes!

1369
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:19,000
抱歉  斯科特
Oh, I'm sorry, Scott.

1370
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,930
他们是你的朋友  这太不体谅了
They're your friends. That's insensitive.

1371
01:07:21,700 --> 01:07:23,480
我太需要赢一局了
I just really needed a win, you know?

1372
01:07:23,490 --> 01:07:24,880
好了  我会稍后回来
Anyway, I'll be back later

1373
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:26,770
正式结束你的刑期
for the official end of your sentence!

1374
01:07:26,770 --> 01:07:28,590
抱歉看错你了  哥们
Sorry for misjudging you, pal!

1375
01:07:28,590 --> 01:07:30,550
你该为自己感到骄傲
You should feel great about yourself!

1376
01:07:54,780 --> 01:07:56,190
-怎么了  -有人受伤
- What is it? - We have a man down.

1377
01:07:56,190 --> 01:07:57,610
皮姆的实验室不见了
And Pym's lab is gone.

1378
01:08:09,460 --> 01:08:11,110
谢谢你掩护我
Thanks for covering for me.

1379
01:08:11,260 --> 01:08:11,890
不客气
Sure.

1380
01:08:15,110 --> 01:08:15,860
那么
So...

1381
01:08:17,020 --> 01:08:19,020
你又开始做蚁人多久了
how long have you been Ant-Man again?

1382
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:24,230
没多久
Not long.

1383
01:08:25,060 --> 01:08:26,580
就那么发生了
It just sort of happened.

1384
01:08:26,840 --> 01:08:28,490
很抱歉我隐瞒了你
I'm sorry for lying to you...

1385
01:08:28,490 --> 01:08:30,630
很抱歉我赌上了一切
and I'm sorry for risking everything.

1386
01:08:30,630 --> 01:08:31,710
爸爸  没事的
Daddy, it's okay.

1387
01:08:31,710 --> 01:08:32,740
不是没事
It's not.

1388
01:08:34,050 --> 01:08:35,410
我做了些蠢事
I do some dumb things...

1389
01:08:35,410 --> 01:08:38,190
而我最爱的人却为此付出代价
and the people that I love the most pay the price.

1390
01:08:38,190 --> 01:08:39,150
主要是你
Mainly you.

1391
01:08:39,150 --> 01:08:41,170
帮助他人不是蠢事
Trying to help people isn't dumb.

1392
01:08:43,760 --> 01:08:45,870
但我几乎每次都搞砸了
I screw it up just about every time.

1393
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:48,900
或许你是需要有人照应你
So, maybe you just need someone watching your back,

1394
01:08:49,490 --> 01:08:50,580
比如找个搭档
like a partner.

1395
01:08:50,580 --> 01:08:53,260
她说得很清楚  那是她最不想做的事了
Well, she's made it clear that's about the last thing she wants.

1396
01:08:53,260 --> 01:08:53,920
谁
Who?

1397
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:55,200
霍普
Hope.

1398
01:08:58,760 --> 01:08:59,890
等等  你想的是谁
Wait, who did you think?

1399
01:08:59,890 --> 01:09:00,520
我
Me.

1400
01:09:01,130 --> 01:09:01,820
你吗
You?

1401
01:09:02,720 --> 01:09:03,930
别笑
Don't laugh.

1402
01:09:04,530 --> 01:09:05,870
我能做个好搭档的
I'd be a great partner.

1403
01:09:05,870 --> 01:09:07,400
小花生
Aw, peanut.

1404
01:09:08,780 --> 01:09:09,930
你肯定可棒了
You would be awesome.

1405
01:09:11,060 --> 01:09:12,220
但如果我允许你做
And if I let you...

1406
01:09:12,220 --> 01:09:13,820
我就是个坏爸爸了
I would be a terrible dad.

1407
01:09:14,910 --> 01:09:15,610
好吧
Fine.

1408
01:09:16,380 --> 01:09:18,890
那就让霍普做你的搭档吧  她挺聪明的
Then have Hope be your partner. She's smart.

1409
01:09:20,900 --> 01:09:22,200
她让我想到了你
She reminds me of you.

1410
01:09:23,050 --> 01:09:24,320
你要去帮她吗
You gonna go help her?

1411
01:09:25,310 --> 01:09:26,700
我觉得你该帮她
I think you should help her.

1412
01:09:27,260 --> 01:09:28,690
我也希望我能
I wish I could, but...

1413
01:09:30,230 --> 01:09:32,690
但我不知道我要怎么帮她而不伤害到你
I don't know how I could help her without hurting you.

1414
01:09:36,380 --> 01:09:37,530
你可以的
You can do it.

1415
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:39,760
你什么都可以做到
You can do anything.

1416
01:09:40,770 --> 01:09:43,060
你是世界上最棒的奶奶
You are the world's greatest grandma.

1417
01:09:51,190 --> 01:09:52,810
吴探员一小时后来见你们
Agent Woo will see you in an hour.

1418
01:09:52,810 --> 01:09:55,220
一小时  我们没有那么多时间
An hour? We don't have an hour.

1419
01:09:55,850 --> 01:09:57,320
你们有别处要去吗
You got somewhere else to be?

1420
01:10:05,290 --> 01:10:07,470
这才是我的好闺女
Oh, now, that's my girl.

1421
01:10:13,730 --> 01:10:15,450
好了  我们的计划是什么
All right, what's our plan?

1422
01:10:17,740 --> 01:10:18,950
缩小那面墙
To shrink that wall.

1423
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:21,090
看上去像是承重墙
It looks load-bearing.

1424
01:10:21,110 --> 01:10:22,060
天花板可能会塌的
The ceiling could collapse.

1425
01:10:22,070 --> 01:10:23,450
那我们就没命跑
Then we run like hell.

1426
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:26,250
我估计这一层有15到20个探员
Now, I estimate 15-20 agents on the floor.

1427
01:10:26,250 --> 01:10:28,250
楼里大概还有五倍这个数的探员
Roughly five times that in the building at large.

1428
01:10:28,250 --> 01:10:29,600
他们都有武器
They're all heavily armed.

1429
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:30,770
胜算不高
Not great odds.

1430
01:10:31,500 --> 01:10:32,730
你有更好的主意吗
You got any better ideas?

1431
01:10:32,730 --> 01:10:33,730
没有
Nope.

1432
01:10:34,630 --> 01:10:36,150
我不会放弃妈妈的
And I'm not giving up on Mom.

1433
01:10:36,870 --> 01:10:38,450
她肯定会为你骄傲的
She'd be so proud of you.

1434
01:10:43,970 --> 01:10:44,670
好了
Okay.

1435
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:47,150
一
One...

1436
01:10:48,270 --> 01:10:49,040
二
two...

1437
01:10:54,220 --> 01:10:55,160
斯科特
Scott?

1438
01:10:55,290 --> 01:10:56,930
你俩傻站着干什么
What're you two just standing around for?

1439
01:10:56,930 --> 01:10:58,570
我们得去找到实验室
We gotta go find that lab.

1440
01:10:59,690 --> 01:11:00,810
那我呢
What about me?

1441
01:11:02,140 --> 01:11:03,180
好啊
Perfect.

1442
01:11:03,190 --> 01:11:05,180
快换衣服  我们没多少时间
Hurry up and get dressed. We don't have much time.

1443
01:11:09,680 --> 01:11:10,330
先生
Sir.

1444
01:11:18,510 --> 01:11:19,910
现在呢
Okay, now what?

1445
01:11:20,140 --> 01:11:21,250
你问我吗
You're asking me?

1446
01:11:24,190 --> 01:11:24,880
进来
Get in!

1447
01:11:36,170 --> 01:11:39,160
打扰  我们打算赶紧离开吗
Excuse me. Are we planning on leaving soon

1448
01:11:39,160 --> 01:11:41,160
还是你俩要继续互相凝视
or are you two gonna keep staring at each other

1449
01:11:41,160 --> 01:11:43,150
直到他们开始冲我们开火
until they start shooting at us?

1450
01:11:43,660 --> 01:11:44,380
好吧
Yeah.

1451
01:11:49,900 --> 01:11:51,330
-伯奇  -嗯
- Hey, Burch. - Yeah.

1452
01:11:51,330 --> 01:11:52,250
他们出来了
Yeah, they're out.

1453
01:11:52,250 --> 01:11:53,380
我就来
I'm on my way.

1454
01:11:58,400 --> 01:11:59,990
她的战衣不见了  车也是
Her suit is missing, and so is the van.

1455
01:11:59,990 --> 01:12:01,020
怎么会这样
How could this happen?

1456
01:12:01,020 --> 01:12:02,640
怎么回事啊
I mean, what the dickens?

1457
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:06,440
谢谢
Thank you.

1458
01:12:07,980 --> 01:12:08,700
不客气
You're welcome.

1459
01:12:10,810 --> 01:12:12,860
我们怎么找到实验室
So, uh, how do we find the lab?

1460
01:12:13,150 --> 01:12:14,740
丢过一次后
After we lost it the first time

1461
01:12:15,100 --> 01:12:16,680
我放了新的追踪器
I put on a new tracker

1462
01:12:17,900 --> 01:12:18,970
算是吧
of sorts.

1463
01:12:28,580 --> 01:12:29,450
这也行
That'll work.

1464
01:12:56,500 --> 01:12:57,640
好没好啊
Is it ready or not?

1465
01:12:58,420 --> 01:13:00,630
我们可以开始进行提取了
We can begin the extraction process.

1466
01:13:02,240 --> 01:13:03,250
听着  艾娃
Listen, Ava.

1467
01:13:03,250 --> 01:13:05,310
这整件事可能会很危险
This whole thing could be very dangerous.

1468
01:13:06,060 --> 01:13:06,800
或许我们该
Maybe we should...

1469
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:09,320
或许我们该什么  等吗
Maybe we should what? Wait?

1470
01:13:10,010 --> 01:13:12,350
我只能再活几天了
I've got days until I'm dead.

1471
01:13:13,500 --> 01:13:14,690
我们要做了  比尔
We're doing this, Bill.

1472
01:13:15,260 --> 01:13:15,960
马上
Now.

1473
01:13:19,060 --> 01:13:21,910
能量读数显示他们还没用过隧道
Energy readings show they have not used the tunnel yet.

1474
01:13:21,910 --> 01:13:23,900
妈妈的位置过不了多久就会变化
We don't have much time before Mom's location shifts,

1475
01:13:23,900 --> 01:13:24,800
我们就会失去她
and we lose her.

1476
01:13:24,810 --> 01:13:26,870
是啊  那之前还有好多事呢
Yeah, and we have a lot to do before then.

1477
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:28,420
我爸爸总说
You know, my pep-pep always said,

1478
01:13:28,420 --> 01:13:30,600
如果你想做好什么事  就列个单子
"If you want to do something right, you make a list."

1479
01:13:30,600 --> 01:13:31,860
我们该那么做
So, we should do that.

1480
01:13:32,020 --> 01:13:34,310
一  我们要闯入实验室
One, we have to break into that lab.

1481
01:13:34,310 --> 01:13:37,130
二  我们要赶走福斯特和幽灵
Two, we have to kick out Foster and Ghost.

1482
01:13:37,130 --> 01:13:39,260
三  我们得跟幽灵打
Three, we're gonna have to fight Ghost.

1483
01:13:39,270 --> 01:13:42,000
这似乎该是二的一部分  二A吧
That seems like it should be part of two. 2-A, all right?

1484
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,390
就算是二A吧
Let's call it 2-A.

1485
01:13:43,420 --> 01:13:45,080
打幽灵  二A
Fight Ghost. 2-A.

1486
01:13:45,350 --> 01:13:47,580
还有  我们得确保实验室恢复到原始大小
Also, we have to make sure that the lab is fully grown

1487
01:13:47,580 --> 01:13:49,240
好让你出来  否则我们就完了
for you to come back. Otherwise, we're screwed.

1488
01:13:49,240 --> 01:13:49,870
斯科特
Scott!

1489
01:13:49,870 --> 01:13:51,200
要我再说一次吗  我再说一次
You want me to start again? I'll start again...

1490
01:13:51,200 --> 01:13:52,780
我去
I'm going to dive.

1491
01:13:54,440 --> 01:13:57,320
我们要想成功  就得你俩在外面
The only chance we got is if the two of you are out here...

1492
01:13:57,420 --> 01:14:00,230
一起保护隧道
together, protecting the tunnel.

1493
01:14:00,820 --> 01:14:03,070
让我去吧  霍普  求你
Let me do this, Hope. Please.

1494
01:14:04,760 --> 01:14:05,940
让我去接她
Let me get her.

1495
01:14:08,180 --> 01:14:09,410
我觉得他是对的
I think he's right.

1496
01:14:17,180 --> 01:14:18,980
好啊
"Whassup?"

1497
01:14:21,960 --> 01:14:23,950
不记得那个特火的广告吗
You don't remember, uh, that beloved commercial?

1498
01:14:24,910 --> 01:14:26,550
"好啊"
"Whassup?"

1499
01:14:27,180 --> 01:14:28,530
我让他跟我们过来的
I had him follow us.

1500
01:14:29,130 --> 01:14:30,920
我觉得我们会需要帮助
I thought we could use some help.

1501
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:34,970
好了  我就位了
All right. I'm in position.

1502
01:14:35,220 --> 01:14:36,310
蚂蚁过去了
The ants are headed in.

1503
01:14:36,310 --> 01:14:37,140
收到
Copy that.

1504
01:14:37,320 --> 01:14:38,750
眼睛放亮了  斯科特
Keep your eyes peeled, Scotty.

1505
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:40,830
-来点糖吗  -不
- Do you want Pez? - No.

1506
01:14:42,380 --> 01:14:43,900
我生日时凯西给我的
Cassie gave me this for my birthday.

1507
01:14:44,500 --> 01:14:46,200
对了  我爱那套战衣
By the way, I love that suit!

1508
01:14:46,890 --> 01:14:47,800
谢谢
Thanks, man.

1509
01:14:49,010 --> 01:14:50,350
真希望我也有一套
I wish I had a suit.

1510
01:14:51,880 --> 01:14:55,590
就算是没多少能力的我也会喜欢的
I would even like a suit with minimal powers, you know?

1511
01:14:56,320 --> 01:14:58,670
或者就是一件没任何能力的战衣
Or maybe even just a suit, with no powers.

1512
01:15:14,850 --> 01:15:15,730
怎么回事
What is it?

1513
01:15:16,720 --> 01:15:17,570
不知道
Don't know.

1514
01:15:22,610 --> 01:15:23,750
是他们
It's them!

1515
01:15:26,490 --> 01:15:27,620
他们肯定就在附近
They can't be far.

1516
01:15:48,590 --> 01:15:50,910
汉克  汉克
All right, Hank. Hank?

1517
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:55,110
爸爸  你什么情况
Dad, what's your status?

1518
01:15:55,310 --> 01:15:56,980
福斯特已经解决了
Foster's taken care of.

1519
01:15:57,640 --> 01:15:58,830
这就换战衣
Suiting up now.

1520
01:16:03,460 --> 01:16:05,250
我只是想救艾娃
I just wanted to save Ava.

1521
01:16:05,550 --> 01:16:07,940
她要面临死亡或更恐怖的命运
She's facing death or something far more terrible.

1522
01:16:08,130 --> 01:16:09,260
她害怕
She's afraid.

1523
01:16:09,890 --> 01:16:12,950
等我回来  会帮你想办法的
I'll help you find a cure when I get back.

1524
01:16:12,990 --> 01:16:14,040
我保证
I promise.

1525
01:16:14,380 --> 01:16:17,330
我们会一起想出个办法来的
Together, we'll figure something out.

1526
01:16:19,640 --> 01:16:20,730
祝你好运  汉克
Good luck, Hank.

1527
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:22,860
谢谢  比尔
Thanks, Bill.

1528
01:16:23,910 --> 01:16:26,130
现在我需要你退后
Now, I'm gonna need you to step back.

1529
01:16:43,820 --> 01:16:47,210
剩余时间  15分钟

01:30:08,420 --> 01:30:09,370
我做了个梦
I had a dream.

1674
01:30:09,370 --> 01:30:11,370
爸爸  妈妈在哪
Daddy? Where's Mommy?

1675
01:30:11,370 --> 01:30:13,140
我们玩时  我每次都藏在那里
It's where I hid every time that we played.

1676
01:30:13,140 --> 01:30:14,790
我爱你  汉克
I love you, Hank.

1677
01:30:30,700 --> 01:30:31,530
爸爸
Daddy?

1678
01:30:36,500 --> 01:30:37,550
爸爸
Daddy?

1679
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,640
爸爸  怎么回事
Dad? What's going on?

1680
01:30:43,930 --> 01:30:45,330
你怎么还没找到妈妈
Why haven't you found Mom?

1681
01:30:47,300 --> 01:30:49,750
你似乎迷路了  汉克  你没事吧
You look lost, Hank. Are you all right?

1682
01:30:51,870 --> 01:30:54,600
还觉得你无所不知吗  汉克
Still think you have all the answers, Hank?

1683
01:31:50,330 --> 01:31:51,180
是我
It's me.

1684
01:32:05,400 --> 01:32:07,260
真对不起
I'm so sorry...

1685
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:11,030
这么久才找到你
it took so long.

1686
01:32:11,030 --> 01:32:11,670
不
No.

1687
01:32:13,970 --> 01:32:14,690
不
No.

1688
01:32:15,900 --> 01:32:16,950
你现在来了
You're here now.

1689
01:32:19,090 --> 01:32:19,990
我们回家吧
Let's go home.

1690
01:32:22,350 --> 01:32:23,970
我以为我完了
I thought I was gone.

1691
01:32:24,870 --> 01:32:27,590
但你手里发出的那股能量
But that energy from your hands...

1692
01:32:27,920 --> 01:32:29,280
你怎么做到的
how did you do that?

1693
01:32:32,200 --> 01:32:35,020
我已经不是30年前的那个女人了  亨利
I'm not the same woman I was 30 years ago, Henry.

1694
01:32:35,260 --> 01:32:36,260
这地方
This place...

1695
01:32:37,730 --> 01:32:39,110
会改变你
it changes you.

1696
01:32:41,200 --> 01:32:44,340
适应是一方面  但也有
Adaptation is part of it, but some of it is...

1697
01:32:44,980 --> 01:32:46,030
进化
evolution.

1698
01:32:48,410 --> 01:32:50,870
实验室坐标未找到
Lab coordinates not found.

1699
01:32:51,140 --> 01:32:52,570
不能上升
Do not ascend.

1700
01:32:53,270 --> 01:32:56,650
我或许该跟你说说上面的情况
I should probably tell you what we're dealing with up there.

1701
01:32:58,140 --> 01:33:01,290
我拿到实验室了
I got the lab. I got the lab.

1702
01:33:01,300 --> 01:33:03,720
让开  让开
Move. Move.

1703
01:33:04,290 --> 01:33:05,590
让开
Move!

1704
01:33:06,310 --> 01:33:08,020
让让路
Get out of the way.

1705
01:33:14,220 --> 01:33:15,010
我们走
Let's go.

1706
01:33:17,100 --> 01:33:20,010
似乎没人知道这是什么
No one here appears to be sure what this is.

1707
01:33:20,020 --> 01:33:23,650
它至少有80到85英尺
It's gotta be 80-85 feet tall.

1708
01:33:28,540 --> 01:33:30,940
快让开
Get out of the way!

1709
01:33:31,090 --> 01:33:33,860
我拿到实验室了
I got the lab.

1710
01:33:36,060 --> 01:33:37,430
空气好厚
The air feels chunky.

1711
01:33:37,430 --> 01:33:39,480
不  他太大了
Oh, no. He's too big.

1712
01:33:43,330 --> 01:33:44,080
斯科特

1713
01:33:44,560 --> 01:33:45,250

我要睡了

1715
01:33:47,620 --> 01:33:50,220
我就睡个五分钟
I'm just gonna go to sleep now for five minutes.

1716
01:33:50,540 --> 01:33:52,220
我就想睡五分钟
I just need five minutes.

1717
01:33:53,020 --> 01:33:54,700
五分钟
Five minutes!

1718
01:34:01,760 --> 01:34:03,040
你把实验室拿去安全的地方
You get the lab somewhere safe.

1719
01:34:03,040 --> 01:34:05,430
-斯科特要没气的  -好
- Scott's air won't last. - Okay.

1720
01:34:20,920 --> 01:34:21,600
走开
Move!

1721
01:34:21,700 --> 01:34:23,440
让开  让开
Move! Move!

1722
01:34:26,400 --> 01:34:27,410
不  等等
No, wait!

1723
01:34:38,780 --> 01:34:40,880
实验室已恢复
Lab at full scale.

1724
01:34:40,880 --> 01:34:41,550
他们做到了
They did it.

1725
01:34:41,550 --> 01:34:43,080
可以上升
Ready to ascend.

1726
01:34:43,220 --> 01:34:44,580
我们去见女儿吧
Let's go see our daughter.

1727
01:35:07,200 --> 01:35:07,900
斯科特
Scott!

1728
01:35:09,900 --> 01:35:10,670

1731
01:35:32,660 --> 01:35:33,380
找到你了
Gotcha.

1732
01:35:37,600 --> 01:35:38,370
斯科特
Scott?

1733
01:35:49,610 --> 01:35:51,610
斯科特  霍普  回复
Scotty! Hope, come in.

1734
01:35:52,340 --> 01:35:53,690
你们被楼压垮了吗
Did you get crushed by the building?

1735
01:35:57,240 --> 01:35:58,610
遥控器呢  路易斯
Where's the remote, Luis?

1736
01:35:59,710 --> 01:36:00,840
可能在那里
It's probably in there.

1737
01:36:01,760 --> 01:36:02,930
不在我这儿
I don't have it. I don't have it.

1738
01:36:03,250 --> 01:36:05,120
看来我们要说
I guess this is where we say

1739
01:36:05,590 --> 01:36:06,880
再见了  哥们
Adios, amigo.

1740
01:36:07,660 --> 01:36:08,740
不不不
No, no, no, no!

1741
01:36:12,710 --> 01:36:13,580
谢谢  伙计们

1745
01:36:27,850 --> 01:36:29,400
提取即将就绪

1746
01:36:29,400 --> 01:36:31,690
请停下  都有人受伤了
Please, stop! People are getting hurt!

1747
01:36:31,690 --> 01:36:34,620
一切都疼  别跟我提痛苦
Everything hurts. Don't talk to me about pain!

1748
01:36:34,620 --> 01:36:35,810
如果汉克是对的呢
What if Hank is right?

1749
01:36:35,990 --> 01:36:37,850
如果这个过程会害死珍妮特呢
What if this process kills Janet?

1750
01:36:37,870 --> 01:36:39,080
怎么  你还担心她
What, you're worried about her?

1751
01:36:39,080 --> 01:36:41,710
我只是说  她是个厉害的科学家
All I'm saying is that she is a brilliant scientist.

1752

她或许能帮你

她会帮我的  就现在

1754
01:36:45,350 --> 01:36:47,480
如果她死了  就死吧
And if she dies, she dies!

1755
01:36:47,480 --> 01:36:50,630
不  对不起  我们不能这么做
No, no. I'm sorry, we can't do this.

1756
01:36:50,650 --> 01:36:52,770
我们得另找办法
We have to find another way.

1757
01:36:55,330 --> 01:36:57,270
这就是办法
This is the way.

1758
01:37:18,640 --> 01:37:19,520
珍妮特
Janet!

1759
01:37:30,620 --> 01:37:32,210
她开始提取了
She started the extraction.

1760
01:37:32,240 --> 01:37:33,920
她会撕碎我妈妈的

1761
01:37:43,290 --> 01:37:44,260
不
No!

妈妈
Mom?

1765
01:39:02,810 --> 01:39:03,820

No more last-minute business trips, okay?

1772

I'm sorry.

1787
01:40:25,910 --> 01:40:27,500
我觉得我能帮你

1789

没事了
It's okay.

1790
01:41:11,480 --> 01:41:12,830
伙计们  警察要来了

You see, we see these guys. They trying to shoot people.

I've also committed numerous health code violations in my restaurant.

有些说出来能吓你一跳
Some of them would shock you.

1804
01:41:53,510 --> 01:41:55,170
还真是吐真剂
It is truth serum.

1805
01:41:59,730 --> 01:42:00,990
我们得离开
We gotta get outta here.

There's nowhere to hide.

1817
01:42:30,960 --> 01:42:34,020
赶紧认输吧  没事的
Just pull off that Band-Aid! You lost! It's okay!

1818
01:42:35,690 --> 01:42:38,230
该死  斯科特  缩小自己

我们可以逃走的
We can make it.

1826
01:43:11,560 --> 01:43:12,900
你也说过
You said it yourself.

1827
01:43:14,100 --> 01:43:15,370
我伤害过人

但你没有
But you haven't.

1829

1833
01:44:09,180 --> 01:44:10,120
你们好啊
Oh, hey, guys.

1834

我的两年这就结束了吗
Are my two years up already?

1835
01:44:19,540 --> 01:44:21,060
外面世界什么样啊
What's it like out there?

1836
01:44:21,710 --> 01:44:24,330
大家还跳舞吗
I mean, do people still dance?

1837
01:44:25,080 --> 01:44:26,670
还有流动餐车这回事吗
Are food trucks still a thing?

1838
01:44:27,200 --> 01:44:29,800
你这次是逃脱了  斯科特
Well, you got away with it this time, Scott, but...

1839
01:44:30,350 --> 01:44:31,530
我们会再见的
I'll be seeing you again.

1840

在哪
Where?

1841
01:44:35,700 --> 01:44:37,220
我们要在哪再见
Where will you be seeing me again?

1842
01:44:38,310 --> 01:44:41,230
就是...泛泛地说
Like, in general...

1843
01:44:41,230 --> 01:44:43,510
下次你再干坏事
The next time you do something bad,

1844

我就会抓到你

我以为你是想邀请我去哪

1847

1848
01:44:52,580 --> 01:44:54,490
我也想啊  你为什么要那么做啊
That's what I was wondering, why would you do that?

去派对  吃饭吗
Like a party, or like, dinner or something?

1850
01:44:56,390 --> 01:44:58,380
我不知道  我以为你都计划好了
I don't know. I thought you planned the evening.

1851
01:44:58,380 --> 01:44:59,510
不  我是"回头再逮你"的意思
No, I meant, "I'll arrest you later, again."

1852
01:44:59,510 --> 01:45:01,180
当然  不然就太奇怪了
Of course, that would be strange.

我也没事...
I mean, because I'm free...

1856
01:45:07,890 --> 01:45:09,000
算了  走吧

You ready?

1858
01:45:19,920 --> 01:45:20,960
